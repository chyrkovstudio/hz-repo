This repository contains the Antora components for the Hazelcast Platform documentation.

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.

== Docs Structure

This section describes some important information about how this repository is structured:

- The component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's `antora.yml` file.
- The navigation for all modules is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.
- The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically build the site using content in the `main` branch as well as any branches that are prefixed with `v/`.

== Release Workflow

Documentation for new releases is hosted in versioned branches that are prefixed with `v/`.

We support documentation for the latest patch releases of minor versions. For example, content for the `4.1` version is hosted in the `v/4.1` branch. This branch contains content for the latest patch release of version 4.1.

The `latest-dev` content (snapshot content) is stored in the `main` branch.

The documentation build process is triggered whenever you create a new branch with the `v/` prefix, push to an existing `v/` branch, or push to the `main` branch.

=== Patch Releases

This section guides you through the steps for releasing documentation for patch releases.

. In the `v/` branch for the minor version whose patch you are releasing, update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file to the new patch version. For example, if you are releasing version 4.1.3, find the `v/4.1` branch and update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file with 4.1.3.
+
NOTE: As soon as you push content to this branch, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

. If you are releasing a new `latest` version, submit a pull request to the `develop` branch of the link:{url-playbook}[`hazelcast/hazelcast-docs`] repository to do the following:
+
- Update the `_redirects` file with your release version of Hazelcast.
+
NOTE: This file is where we alias the `latest` path in URLs.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Redirect latest hazelcast alias to the latest version
/hazelcast/latest/*  /hazelcast/5.1/:splat 200!
----
+
- In the `search-config.json` file, change the value of the `variables.version` field to your release version.
+
NOTE: This file is where we specify which documentation version to index for the search.

== Major and Minor Releases

This section guides you through the steps for releasing documentation for major and minor releases.

. Create a new release branch from the `main` branch. For example if youâ€™re working on content for version 5.1, create a release branch named `5.1`. You can add the new content and/or fixes to this branch before the release.

. In the `antora.yml` file of your release branch, do the following:
+
- Update the `version`, `display_version`, and `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` fields with the major and minor version of Hazelcast that you are releasing.
+
- Delete the `prerelease` field.
+
For example version `5.0-SNAPSHOT` becomes `5.0`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: '5.0'
display_version: '5.0'
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    full-version: '5.0'
----

. If you are releasing a new `latest-dev` version, in the `antora.yml` file of the `main` branch, increment the `version` field to the `latest-dev` version. For example, `5.1-SNAPSHOT` becomes `5.2-SNAPSHOT`.

. When you're ready to release, create the maintenance branch from the release branch. For example if you are releasing version 5.1, create a maintenance branch called `v/5.1` from the `5.1` branch.
+
NOTE: As soon as you push the maintenance branch to the repository, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

. In the `develop` branch of the `hazelcast/hazelcast-docs` repository, submit a pull request to update the `_redirects` file with the new versions of Hazelcast.
+
NOTE: This file is where we alias the `latest-dev` and `latest` paths in URLs.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Redirect latest hazelcast alias to the latest version
/hazelcast/latest/*  /hazelcast/5.1/:splat 200!
# Redirect latest-dev hazelcast alias to the latest-dev version
/hazelcast/latest-dev/*  /hazelcast/5.2-snapshot/:splat 200!
----

- In the `develop` branch of the `hazelcast/hazelcast-docs` repository, submit a pull request to update the `search-config.json` file with the new versions of Hazelcast.
+
NOTE: This file is where we specify which documentation version to index for the search.
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "index_name": "prod_hazelcast_docs",
  "start_urls": [
    {
      "url": "https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/(?P<version>.*?)/",
      "tags": [
        "hazelcast"
      ],
      "variables": {
        "version": ["5.1"]
      },
----

. Delete the release branch. For example, if you released version `5.1`, delete the `5.1` branch. This step helps to keep the repository clean of release branches.


== GitHub Actions
