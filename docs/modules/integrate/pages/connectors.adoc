= Connector Guides
:description: Hazelcast comes out of the box with many different connectors for accessing data in a variety of platforms. These connectors are configured to read and write data in the most efficient way for their respective system. Explore the available connectors and choose one for your use case.
:page-aliases: sql:connectors.adoc, pipelines:sources-sinks.adoc

{description}

You can use connectors as either sources or sinks. Sources allow Hazelcast to read data from them either for xref:query:sql-overview.adoc[queries] or as part of a larger xref:pipelines:overview.adoc[data pipeline]. Sinks allow Hazelcast to write data such as query results to them.

== Processing Guarantees

Some connectors support streaming, in which case they will have either an xref:pipelines:configuring-jobs.adoc#setting-a-processing-guarantee-for-streaming-jobs[at-least-once or exactly-once processing guarantee].

Connectors that do not support streaming do not have any processing guarantees. Instead, during intermittent failures, you must restart any queries or jobs that use these connectors.

== Connectors for SQL

You can use the followng connectors in SQL by configuring them in the xref:sql:create-mapping.adoc[`CREATE MAPPING` statement].
