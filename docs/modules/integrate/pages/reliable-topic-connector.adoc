= Reliable Topic Connector

Reliable Topic provides a simple pub/sub messaging API which can be
used as a data sink within a pipeline.

== Installing the Connector

The map connector is included in the full and slim
distributions of Hazelcast.

== Permissions
[.enterprise]*Enterprise*

If xref:security:enabling-jaas.adoc[security] is enabled, you can set up permissions to restrict clients' access to these data structures. For details, see xref:security:native-client-security.adoc[].

== Reliable Topic as a Source or Sink

```java
hz.getReliableTopic("topic")
   .addMessageListener(message -> System.out.println(message));

Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(TestSources.itemStream(100))
  .withIngestionTimestamps()
  .writeTo(Sinks.reliableTopic("topic"));
```

A simple example is supplied above. For a more advanced version, also
