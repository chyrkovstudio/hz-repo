= JCache Providers

Use JCache providers to create caches for a
specification compliant implementation. Those
providers abstract the platform
specific behavior and bindings and provide the
different JCache required features.

Hazelcast has two types of providers. Depending on your
application setup and the cluster topology,
you can use the Client Provider (used by Hazelcast clients)
or the Member Provider (used by cluster members).

For more information about cluster topologies and Hazelcast
clients, see the xref:deploy:choosing-a-deployment-option.adoc[].

== Configuring JCache Provider

Hazelcast provides three `CachingProvider` implementations:

 * A member-side implementation: the ``CacheManager``s created by this provider are backed by
member-side ``HazelcastInstance``s.
 * A client-side implementation: the ``CacheManager``s created by this provider are backed by
client-side ``HazelcastInstance``s.
 * A delegating caching provider that can be configured to delegate to the member-
or client-side implementation.

When Hazelcast is the only JCache provider on the classpath, the default
caching provider returned by `javax.cache.CachingProvider#getCachingProvider()` is
the delegating `CachingProvider`.

```java
// provides the default delegating caching provider
CachingProvider provider = javax.cache.Caching.getCachingProvider();
```

By default, the delegating caching provider chooses the client-side implementation,
however it can be configured to explicitly pick the client- or member-side implementation.
This is achieved by setting the `hazelcast.jcache.provider.type` system property to `client`
or `member`. The legacy value `server` is also accepted as an alias for `member`, however its
usage is discouraged as it will be removed in a future version.

```java
System.setProperty("hazelcast.jcache.provider.type", "member");
// the returned provider will delegate to the member-side caching provider
CachingProvider provider = javax.cache.Caching.getCachingProvider();
```

You can also configure the default `CachingProvider` by setting its fully qualified
class name to the value of the `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider` system property.
The system property can be defined at the `java` command line (using
`-Djavax.cache.spi.CachingProvider=<fully-qualified-class-name>`) or
programmatically using `java.lang.System#setProperty(String, String)`.

The JCache API also provides methods to explicitly request the instantiation of
a specific `CachingProvider` by supplying its fully qualified class name. This is
useful to explicitly choose Hazelcast as `CachingProvider` in case multiple
implementations reside on the classpath.

```java
// provides the member-side caching provider
CachingProvider provider = Caching.getCachingProvider("com.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastMemberCachingProvider");
```

Since Hazelcast 4.0.3 the fully qualified class names for Hazelcast's `CachingProvider` implementations are:

 * Delegating `CachingProvider` (picks member- or client-side provider depending on configuration):
`com.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastCachingProvider`
 * Member-side: `com.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastMemberCachingProvider`. The legacy class name
`com.hazelcast.cache.impl.HazelcastServerCachingProvider` is also accepted, however its usage is
discouraged and will be removed in a future version.
 * Client-side: `com.hazelcast.client.cache.HazelcastClientCachingProvider`. The legacy class name
`com.hazelcast.client.cache.impl.HazelcastClientCachingProvider` is also accepted, however its usage is
discouraged and will be removed in a future version.
