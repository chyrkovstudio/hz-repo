= {ucd}
:description: The previous method of dynamically loading custom classes or domain classes from other members, or deploying your code from your client was known as {ucd}. This method has been deprecated and will be removed at the next major version. The legacy information for the deprecated {ucd} solution has been retained in this section for your reference.

{description}

{ucn} is only available to {enterprise-product-name} Edition users.

Hazelcast recommends that {enterprise-product-name} Edition users migrate to {ucn} to benefit from the improved and extended capabilities that it offers.

After the next major release, {open-source-product-name} users can either upgrade to {enterprise-product-name} Edition, or add their resources to the Hazelcast member class paths.

For further information on migrating from {ucd} to {ucn}, see the xref:clusters:ucn-migrate-ucd.adoc[] topic.

For further information on upgrading to Hazelcast Platform from IMDG, see the xref:migrate:upgrading-from-imdg-3.adoc[] or xref:migrate:upgrading-from-imdg-4.adoc[] topics.
