= Deadline Failure Detector

_Deadline Failure Detector_ uses an absolute timeout for missing/lost
heartbeats. After timeout, a member is considered as crashed/unavailable
and marked as suspected.

NOTE: By default, Hazelcast uses the _Deadline Failure Detector_ for failure detection.

The following example provides a configuration, with callouts that describe the properties:

<1> The value must be `deadline`.
<2> [[heartbeat-interval]]Interval at which member heartbeat messages are sent to each other.
<3> [[heartbeat-timeout]]Timeout that defines when a cluster member is suspect because it has not sent any heartbeats.
