= Deadline Failure Detector

_Deadline Failure Detector_ uses an absolute timeout for missing/lost
heartbeats. After timeout, a member is considered as crashed/unavailable
and marked as suspected.

NOTE: _Deadline Failure Detector_ is the default failure detector in Hazelcast.

The following is an example configuration with property descriptions.

<1> The value must be `deadline`.

<3> [[heartbeat-timeout]]Timeout which defines when a cluster member is suspected because it has not sent any heartbeats.
