= Ping Failure Detector

The Ping Failure Detector may be configured in addition to one of Deadline and
Phi Accrual Failure Detectors. It operates at Layer 3 of the OSI protocol and
provides much quicker and more deterministic detection of hardware and other
lower level events. This detector may be configured to perform an extra check
after a member is suspected by one of the other detectors, or it can work in
parallel, which is the default. This way hardware and network level issues are
detected more quickly.

This failure detector is based on `InetAddress.isReachable()`.
When the JVM process has enough permissions to create RAW sockets, the
implementation chooses to rely on ICMP Echo requests. This is preferred.

If there are not enough permissions, it can be configured to fallback on
attempting a TCP Echo on port 7. In the latter case, both a successful
connection or an explicit rejection is treated as "Host is Reachable".
Or, it can be forced to use only RAW sockets. This is not preferred as
each call creates a heavyweight socket and moreover the Echo service is
typically disabled.

For the Ping Failure Detector to rely **only** on ICMP Echo requests,
there are some criteria that need to be met.

[[requirements-and-linuxunix-configuration]]
== Requirements and Linux/Unix Configuration

* **Supported OS: as of Java 1.8 only Linux/Unix environments are supported**.
This detector relies on ICMP, i.e., the protocol behind the `ping` command.
It tries to issue the ping attempts periodically, and their responses are used
to determine the reachability of the remote member. However, you cannot simply
create an ICMP Echo Request because these type of packets do not rely on any of
the preexisting transport protocols such as TCP. In order to create such a request,
you must have the privileges to create RAW sockets (see https://linux.die.net/man/7/raw[https://linux.die.net/man/7/raw^]).
Most operating systems allow this to the root users, however Unix based ones
are more flexible and allow the use of custom privileges per process
instead of requiring root access. Therefore, this detector is supported only on Linux.
* **The Java executable must have the `cap_net_raw` capability.** As described in
the above requirement, on Linux, you have the ability to define extra capabilities
to a single process, which would allow the process to interact with the RAW sockets.
This interaction is achieved via the capability `cap_net_raw`
(see https://linux.die.net/man/7/capabilities[https://linux.die.net/man/7/capabilities^]).
To enable this capability run the following command:
+
`sudo setcap cap_net_raw=+ep <JDK_HOME>/jre/bin/java`
+
* **When running with custom capabilities, the dynamic linker on Linux rejects
loading the libs from untrusted paths.** Since you have now `cap_net_raw` as a
custom capability for a process, it becomes suspicious to the dynamic linker
and throws an error: `java: error while loading shared libraries: libjli.so:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
** To overcome this rejection, the `<JDK_HOME>/jre/lib/amd64/jli/` path needs
to be added in the `ld.conf`. Run the following command to do this:
`echo "<JDK_HOME>/jre/lib/amd64/jli/" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/java.conf && sudo ldconfig`
* **ICMP Echo Requests must not be blocked by the receiving hosts.**
`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all` set to `0`.
Run the following command:
+
`echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all`

If any of the above criteria isn't met, then the `isReachable`
always falls back on TCP Echo attempts on port 7.

To be able to use the Ping Failure Detector, you can configure it
using the `icmp` element in your Hazelcast declarative configuration
file, e.g., `hazelcast.xml`. An example is shown below:

The following are the element and attribute descriptions:

* `enabled`: Specifies whether the legacy ICMP detection mode is enabled; works
cooperatively with the existing failure detector and only kicks-in after
a pre-defined period has passed with no heartbeats from a member.
Its default value is `false`.
* `parallel-mode`: Specifies whether the parallel ping detector is enabled;
works separately from the other detectors. Its default value is `true`.
* `timeout-milliseconds`: Number of milliseconds until a ping attempt
is considered failed if there was no reply. Its default value is `1000` milliseconds.
* `max-attempts`: Maximum number of ping attempts before
the member/node gets suspected by the detector. Its default value is `2`.
* `interval-milliseconds`: Interval, in milliseconds, between each ping
attempt. 1000ms (1 sec) is also the minimum interval allowed.
Its default value is `1000` milliseconds.
* `ttl`: Maximum number of hops the packets should
go through. Its default value is `0`.
* `fail-fast-on-startup`: Specifies whether the cluster member fails to start
if it is unable to action an ICMP ping command when ICMP is enabled. Failure
is usually due to OS level restrictions.

In the above example configuration, the Ping detector attempts 3 pings, one every second and
waits up to 1 second for each to complete. If after 3 seconds, there was no successful
ping, the member gets suspected.

To enforce the <<requirements-and-linuxunix-configuration, Requirements>>, the property
`hazelcast.icmp.echo.fail.fast.on.startup` can also be set to `true`, in which case,
if any of the requirements isn't met, Hazelcast fails to start.

Below is a summary table of all possible configuration combinations
of the ping failure detector.

| Legacy ping mode. This works hand-to-hand with the OSI Layer 7 failure
detector (see. phi or deadline in the sections above). Ping in this mode
only kicks in after a period when there are no heartbeats received, in which
case the remote Hazelcast member is pinged up to a configurable count of attempts.
If all those attempts fail, the member gets suspected. You can configure this
attempt count using the `max-attempts` configuration element listed above.
