= Accessing Domain Objects Without Domain Classes
:page-beta: true
[[accessing-domain-objects-without-domain-classes]]

Usually, to access any field in a domain object, you would need to have the class of that object on the member's
classpath. However, you may not want to add classes on the member. In this case, Hazelcast can return a `GenericRecord`
object to your *Java* application. This object gives you access to your domain object's fields without having to
add a factory class to the classpath of your members or register a serializer for them.

Hazelcast is able to represent xref:serialization:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[Portable] and
xref:serialization:compact-serialization.adoc[Compact serialized] objects as `GenericRecord`.

For example, to access the fields of a domain object in an entry processor, you could do the following:

[source,java]
----
map.executeOnKey(key, (EntryProcessor<Object, Object, Object>) entry -> {
    Object value = entry.getValue();
    GenericRecord genericRecord = (GenericRecord) value;

    int id = genericRecord.getInt32("id");

    return null;
});
----

[NOTE]
====
An alternative approach introduced in the previous Hazelcast releases is the xref:clusters:deploying-code-on-member.adoc[User Code Deployment]
feature to deploy the classes from the client to the cluster.
However, it has a restriction: you cannot upload
a new version of your class to the cluster if you use the portable versioning support.
Loading two different versions of the same class on the JVM is not a problem that we want to solve: using `GenericRecord`,
you can easily write different versions of your classes
from the clients and access them without using the User Code Deployment feature.

With the introduction of `GenericRecord`, User Code Deployment should be used only for functional objects like `Runnable`,
`Callable` and `EntryProcessor`.

== Creating New Portable Objects

To create a `GenericRecord` object in portable format, use the `GenericRecordBuilder.portable()` method:

[source,java]
----
ClassDefinition classDefinition = new ClassDefinitionBuilder(PORTABLE_FACTORY_ID, EMPLOYEE_CLASS_ID)
                        .addStringField("name")
                        .addIntField("id")
                        .build();

GenericRecord namedRecord = GenericRecordBuilder.portable(classDefinition)
                .setString("name", "foo")
                .setInt32("id", 123)
                .build();
----

Note that the class definitions are better to be created once and
used when creating different instances of the same `GenericRecord` object.

== Creating New Compact Objects

To create a `GenericRecord` object in compact serialization format, use the `GenericRecordBuilder.compact()` method:

[source,java]
----
GenericRecord namedRecord = GenericRecordBuilder.compact("employee")
        .setString("name", "foo")
        .setInt32("id", 123)
        .build();
----

Note that there is no need to create a class definition, or a schema in this case. A schema will be created
from the fields of the builder automatically.

== Adding and Changing Values in Domain Objects

We have also added two convenience methods in `GenericRecord` for you to
avoid passing a class definition or re-calculating schema. For example, if you want to modify a value and
put it back using an entry processor, you don't need to create a class definition or pay the cost of re-calculating
a schema. Instead, you can create a builder from the `GenericRecord` object which carries the same class definition
or schema as follows:

[source,java]
----
map.executeOnKey("key", (EntryProcessor<Object, Object, Object>) entry -> {
    GenericRecord genericRecord = (GenericRecord) entry.getValue();
    GenericRecord modifiedGenericRecord = genericRecord.newBuilder()
            .setString("name", "Kermit")
            .setInt64("id", 4)
            .setInt32("age", 20)
            .setString("surname", "The Frog")
            .build();
    entry.setValue(modifiedGenericRecord);
    return null;
});
----

Another convenience method is `cloneWithBuilder()`. This is useful if you want to update only
a couple of fields from the original `genericRecord`. In that case, the new builder carries
both `classDefinition` or `schema` and values from the original
`genericRecord`. Here is the same example where we just update the age:

[source,java]
----
map.executeOnKey("key", (EntryProcessor<Object, Object, Object>) entry -> {
    GenericRecord genericRecord = (GenericRecord) entry.getValue();
    GenericRecord modifiedGenericRecord = genericRecord.cloneWithBuilder()
            .setInt32("age", 22)
            .build();
    entry.setValue(modifiedGenericRecord);
    return null;
});
