CAUTION: {ucd} has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. To continue deploying your user code after this time, {open-source-product-name} users can either upgrade to {enterprise-product-name} Edition, or add their resources to the Hazelcast member class paths. Hazelcast recommends that {enterprise-product-name} users migrate their user code to use {ucn}. For further information on migrating from {ucd} to {ucn}, see the xref:clusters:ucn-migrate-ucd.adoc[] topic.
