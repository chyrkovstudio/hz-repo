CAUTION: {ucd} has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. To continue deploying your user code after this time, Open Source users can either upgrade to Enterprise Edition, or add their resources to the Hazelcast member class paths. Hazelcast recommends that Enterprise users migrate their user code to use {ucn}. For further information on migrating from {ucd} to {ucn}, see the xref:clusters:ucn-migrate-ucd.adoc[] topic.
