.Configuration options for dynamic configuration
[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
| Option|Description

|dynamic-configuration
| Root configuration

| persistence-enabled
| Whether changes made in dynamic configuration are persisted to a configuration file. Default: false.

| persistence-file
| Relative or absolute path to a configuration file. Changes made in dynamic configuration will be persisted to this file. This file must either be the configuration file that is used to start the member or it must be imported into that file. See xref:configuring-declaratively.adoc#composing-declarative-configuration[Importing Configuration Snippets into Files] Default: Path to the configuration file that was used to start the Hazelcast member.

| backup-dir
| Relative or absolute path to a directory in which to store backups of the persistence file. Each new backup will be created inside this directory. If this option is not given, a new directory will be created in the node startup directory.                            

| backup-count
| Number of backups of the configuration file to keep. To disable backups, set this option to 0. Default: 5.
