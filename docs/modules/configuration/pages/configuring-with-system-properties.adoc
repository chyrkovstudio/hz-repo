= Configuring with System Properties and Environment Variables
[[configuring-with-system-properties]]
:description: You can use xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc[system properties] and environment variables to configure Hazelcast and override existing settings in a root configuration file. Environment variables are useful for configuring members in containerized environments.

.Using Java?
NOTE: If you use xref:configuring-programmatically.adoc#builders[configuration builders] or the `new Config()` constructor with the Java member API, you cannot override existing configuration with system properties and environment variables. To override existing configuration, you must use xref:configuring-programmatically.adoc#loaders[configuration loaders].

include::partial$warning-override.adoc[]

You can set
system properties as name and value pairs through declarative configuration,
programmatic configuration, or JVM arguments:

==== 
XML::

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <properties>
        <property name="hazelcast.property.foo">value</property>
    </properties>
    ...
</hazelcast>

YAML::

Config config = new Config();
config.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );

== Naming System Properties and Environment Variables

The names of system properties and environment variables follow a consistent pattern, where the names match those in the YAML declarative configuration file. See xref:configuring-declaratively.adoc[].

NOTE: All entries need to mirror the YAML configuration structure which differs slightly to XML. And, you cannot configure settings that use YAML lists.

The names of environment variables follow these rules:

* Each configuration entry needs to start with `HZ_` for member configuration or `HZCLIENT_` for client configuration.
* A new configuration level should be introduced with an underscore (`_`).
* Dashes (`-`) should be removed.
* Names should be in upper case.

The names of system properties must follow these rules:

* Each configuration entry needs to start with `hz.` for member configuration or `hz-client.` for client configuration.
* A new configuration level should be introduced with a dot (`.`).
* Names should be in lower case.

For example, consider the following configuration settings.

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  cluster-name: dev
  network:
    port:
      auto-increment: true
----

You can override these settings by using the following environment variables or system properties:

.Environment variables
[source,shell]
----
HZ_CLUSTERNAME=dev
HZ_NETWORK_PORT_AUTOINCREMENT=true
----

.System properties
[source,shell]
----
hz.cluster-name=dev
hz.network.port.auto-increment=true
----
