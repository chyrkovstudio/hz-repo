= Configuring Hazelcast in Spring
[[configuring-within-spring-context]]

If you use Hazelcast with https://spring.io/[Spring^] you can declare beans
using the namespace `hazelcast`. When you add the namespace declaration to
the element `beans` in the Spring context file, you can start to use the
namespace shortcut `hz` to be used as a bean declaration. See xref:spring:configuration.adoc[Configuring Hazelcast in Spring]
for information on the configuration of Hazelcast-Spring integration.
