IMPORTANT: If you override a value in a configuration file, the other values in the same block are reset to their defaults. For example, if you override the `hazelcast.map.backup-count` value, all other settings within the `map` block are reset to their defaults. To avoid the other values being reset to their defaults, you must override all values in the block.
