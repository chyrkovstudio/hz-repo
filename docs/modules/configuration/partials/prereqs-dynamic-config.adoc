You can add new configuration only for some features. See xref:dynamic-data-structure-configuration.adoc#supported-configuration[Supported Configuration].

NOTE: You can only add new configuration. You cannot use dynamic configuration to override existing configuration at runtime.

Dynamic configuration changes are not persisted by default. To enable persistence, see xref:dynamic-config-options.adoc[].
