You can add new configuration only for some features. See xref:dynamic-config.adoc#supported-dynamic-configuration-changes[Supported Dynamic Configuration Changes].

NOTE: You can only add new configuration. You cannot use dynamic configuration to override existing configuration at runtime.

Dynamic configuration changes are not persisted by default. See xref:dynamic-config-persistence.adoc[Dynamic Configuration Persistence].
