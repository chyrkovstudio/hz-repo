= Handling Partial Propagation

When you submit dynamic configuration changes to a member, they are propagated across all cluster members as well as those that may join the cluster later. If a failure occurs, such as timeouts, network partitions, or IO failures, you need to try adding the dynamic configuration changes again, dynamic changes are idempotent.
