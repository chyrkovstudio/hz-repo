= 5.1.4 Release Notes

== Enhancements

* Removed the `hazelcast-jet-cdc-mysql` module from the Hazelcast Platform Enterprise distributions due to licensing.
You need to manually download this module if you have the Enterprise edition. See xref:pipelines:cdc.adoc#step-4-start-hazelcast[Capture Changes from MySQL] for details. #5312
* The Kubernetes discovery plugin has been enhanced to support the service token expiration. The token is time-bound and its content
is refreshed periodically in the recent Kubernetes versions. A new token reader has been implemented to get the token value periodically.

* You can now provide comma-separated lists to give multiple labels for the Kubernetes Discovery Plugin configurations `service-label-name`, `service-label-value`, `pod-label-name`, and `pod-label-value`.
