= 5.2.4 Release Notes

== Enhancements

* Updated the version of `jackson-core` dependency to 2.15.2.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24730[#24730]
* Hazelcast was sending requests to Kubernetes API when deploying an application with embedded Hazelcast and `service-dns` (DNS lookup mode) specified to a Kubernetes cluster. This was causing the requests to be unsuccessful and the application not to start. This mechanism has been improved by creating Kubernetes client only for the DNS lookup mode.

== Fixes 

* Fixed an issue where a member with persistence can be restarted even though the persistence file structure is not valid (e.g., the persistence directory does not contain the required files). #5876
* Fixed an issue where some of the members in a Hazelcast cluster deployed on Kubernetes (as a statefulset) shut down with en exception in a delayed manner.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24709[#24709]
* Fixed an issue where Jet job snapshots could be prematurely deleted after a restart of a cluster, having lossless restart enabled.

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/24624[#24624]
