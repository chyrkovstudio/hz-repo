= 5.3.6 Release Notes

== Fixes

* Fixed a WAN replication failure - when using maps with WAN replication enabled, and BINARY or NATIVE in-memory formats for the entries, WAN replication was failing when an entry is updated with the same key/value pair, and the cluster members lack serialization information.
