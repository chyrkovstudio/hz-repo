== New Features

== Breaking Changes
* The meaning of the maxDegree (max-degree) for vector collection parameter has changed:
it now represents the maximum number of neighbors per node, instead of half of the maximum number.
If you built a vector collection with a `maxDegree` using Hazelcast version 5.5.0,
you should use `2 * maxDegree` when building it with version 6.0.0.
