== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where a member with persistence can be restarted even though the persistence file structure is not valid (e.g., the persistence directory does not contain the required files). #5878

* Fixed protocol handshake issues in the IO subsystem, including the `TLSv1.3` handshake.
