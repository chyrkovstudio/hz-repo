= CP Subsystem Overview

CP Subsystem is a component of a Hazelcast cluster that builds a strongly
consistent layer for a set of distributed data structures. Its APIs can be used
for implementing distributed coordination use cases, such as leader election,
distributed locking, synchronization, and metadata management. It is accessed
via `HazelcastInstance.getCPSubsystem()`. Its data structures are _CP_ with
respect to the http://awoc.wolski.fi/dlib/big-data/Brewer_podc_keynote_2000.pdf[_CAP_ principle^],
i.e., they always maintain linearizability
and prefer consistency over availability during network partitions. Besides
network partitions, CP Subsystem withstands server and client failures.

Currently, CP Subsystem contains only the implementations of Hazelcast's
concurrency APIs; it supports the following Hazelcast data structures:

* FencedLock
* IAtomicLong
* ISemaphore
* IAtomicReference
* ICountDownLatch

Since the above structures do not maintain large states, all members of
a Hazelcast cluster do not necessarily take part in CP Subsystem. The number of
Hazelcast members that take part in CP Subsystem is specified with
`CPSubsystemConfig.setCPMemberCount(int)`. Say that it is configured as `N`.
Then, when a Hazelcast cluster starts, the first `N` members form CP Subsystem.
These members are called _CP members_ and they can also contain data for
the other regular _AP_ Hazelcast data structures, such as `IMap`, `ISet`.

Data structures in CP Subsystem run in _CP groups_. Each CP group elects its
own Raft leader and runs the https://raft.github.io/[Raft consensus algorithm^]
independently. CP Subsystem runs 2 CP groups by default:

* The first one is _the METADATA CP group_ which is an internal CP group
responsible for managing CP members and CP groups. It is initialized during
cluster startup if CP Subsystem is enabled via `CPSubsystemConfig.setCPMemberCount(int)`.
* The second CP group is _the DEFAULT CP group_, whose name is given in
`CPGroup.DEFAULT_GROUP_NAME`. If a group name is not specified while creating
a CP data structure proxy, that data structure is mapped to _the DEFAULT CP
group_. For instance, when a CP `IAtomicLong` instance is created via
`CPSubsystem.getAtomicLong("myAtomicLong")`, it is initialized on
_the DEFAULT CP group_.

Besides these 2 predefined CP groups, custom CP groups can be created at
run-time while fetching the CP data structure proxies. For instance, if a CP
`IAtomicLong` is created by calling `.getAtomicLong("myAtomicLong@myGroup")`,
first a new CP group is created with the name `myGroup` and then `myAtomicLong`
is initialized on this custom CP group.

This design implies that each CP member can participate to more than one CP
group. CP Subsystem runs a periodic background task to ensure that each CP
member performs the Raft leadership role for roughly equal number of CP groups.
For instance, if there are 3 CP members and 3 CP groups, each CP member becomes
Raft leader for only 1 CP group. If one more CP group is created, then one of
the CP members gets the Raft leader role for 2 CP groups. This is done because
Raft is a leader-based consensus algorithm. A Raft leader member becomes
responsible for handling incoming requests from callers and replicating them to
follower members. If a CP member gets the Raft leadership role for too many CP
groups compared to other CP members, it can turn into a bottleneck.

CP member count of CP groups are specified via
`CPSubsystemConfig.setGroupSize(int)`. Please note that this configuration does
not have to be the same with the CP member count. Namely, the number of CP members in
CP Subsystem can be larger than the configured CP group size. CP groups usually
consist of an odd number of CP members between 3 and 7. Operations are
committed and executed only after they are successfully replicated to
the majority of CP members in a CP group. An odd number of CP members is more
advantageous to an even number because of the quorum or majority calculations.
For a CP group of `N` members, the majority is calculated as `N / 2 + 1`. For
instance, in a CP group of 5 CP members, operations are committed when they are
replicated to at least 3 CP members. This CP group can tolerate the failure of 2 CP
members and remain available. However, if we run a CP group with 6 CP members,
it can still tolerate the failure of 2 CP members because the majority of 6 is 4.
Therefore, it does not improve the degree of fault tolerance compared to 5 CP
members. In summary, CP subsystem remains available (and executes the operations)
as long as the majority ((N/2) + 1) of the members are alive.

CP Subsystem achieves horizontal scalability thanks to all
the aforementioned CP group management capabilities. You can scale out
the throughput and memory capacity by distributing your CP data structures to
multiple CP groups, i.e., manual partitioning / sharding, and distributing
those CP groups over CP members, i.e., choosing a CP group size that is smaller
than the CP member count configuration. Nevertheless, the current set of CP
data structures has quite low memory overheads. Moreover, related to the Raft
consensus algorithm, each CP group makes use of internal heartbeat RPCs to
maintain authority of the Raft leader and help lagging CP group members to make
progress. Last, the new CP lock and semaphore implementations rely on a brand
new session mechanism. In a nutshell, a Hazelcast server or a client starts
a new session on the corresponding CP group when it makes its very first lock
or semaphore acquire request, and then periodically commits session heartbeats
to this CP group in order to indicate its liveliness. It means that if CP
locks and semaphores are distributed to multiple CP groups, there will be
a session management overhead on each CP group. See
the xref:sessions.adoc[CP Sessions section] for more details. For these reasons,
we recommend developers to use a minimal number of CP groups. For most use
cases, _the DEFAULT CP group_ should be sufficient to maintain all CP data
structure instances. Custom CP groups is recommended only when you benchmark
your deployment and decide that performance of _the DEFAULT CP group_ is not
sufficient for your workload.

By default, CP Subsystem works only in memory without persisting any state to
disk. It means that a crashed CP member is not able to join to the cluster back
by restoring its previous state. Therefore, crashed CP members create a danger
for gradually losing majority of CP groups and eventually cause the total loss
of availability of CP Subsystem. To prevent such situations, crashed CP members
can be removed from CP Subsystem and replaced in CP groups with other available
CP members. This flexibility provides a good degree of fault tolerance at
run-time. See the xref:configuration.adoc[CP Subsystem Configuration section]
and xref:management.adoc[CP Subsystem Management section] for more
details. Moreover, CP Subsystem Persistence enables more robustness. When it is
enabled, CP members persist their local state to stable storage and can restore
their state after crashes. See the xref:persistence.adoc[CP Subsystem Persistence section]
for more details.

[WARNING]
====
The CP data structure proxies differ from the other data Hazelcast structure
proxies in two aspects:

* An internal commit is performed on _the METADATA CP group_ every time you
fetch a proxy from this interface. Hence, the callers should cache the returned proxy
objects.
* If you call the `DistributedObject.destroy()` method on a CP data structure
proxy, that data structure is terminated on the underlying CP group and cannot
be reinitialized until the CP group is force-destroyed via
`CPSubsystemManagementService.forceDestroyCPGroup(String)`. For this reason,
please make sure that you are completely done with a CP data structure before
destroying its proxy.

WARNING: **CP Subsystem operates in _the unsafe mode_ by default without
the strong consistency guarantee.** See the
xref:unsafe-mode.adoc[CP Subsystem Unsafe Mode] section for more
information. You should set a positive number to the CP member count
configuration to enable CP Subsystem and use it with the strong consistency
guarantee. See the xref:configuration.adoc[CP Subsystem Configuration]
section for details.
