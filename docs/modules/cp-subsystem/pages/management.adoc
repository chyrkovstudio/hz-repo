= CP Subsystem Management

Unlike the dynamic nature of Hazelcast clusters, CP Subsystem requires manual
intervention while expanding/shrinking its size, or when a CP member crashes or
becomes unreachable. When a CP member becomes unreachable, it is not
automatically removed from CP Subsystem because it could be still alive and
partitioned away.

Moreover, by default CP Subsystem works in memory without persisting any state
to disk. It means that a crashed CP member will not be able to recover by
reloading its previous state. Therefore, crashed CP members create a danger for
gradually losing the majority of CP groups and eventually total loss of
the availability of CP Subsystem. To prevent such situations,
`CPSubsystemManagementService` offers a set of APIs. In addition, CP Subsystem
Persistence can be enabled to make CP members persist their local CP state to
stable storage. Please see xref:persistence.adoc[CP Subsystem Persistence section]
for more details.

CP Subsystem relies on Hazelcast's failure detectors to test reachability of CP
members. Before removing a CP member from CP Subsystem, please make sure that
it is declared as unreachable by Hazelcast's failure detector and removed from
Hazelcast cluster's member list.

CP member additions and removals are internally handled by performing a single
membership change at a time. When multiple CP members are shutting down
concurrently, their shutdown process is executed serially. When a CP membership
change is triggered, _the METADATA CP group_ creates a membership change plan
for CP groups. Then, the scheduled changes are applied to the CP groups one by
one. After all CP group member removals are done, the shutting down CP member
is removed from the active CP members list and its shutdown process is
completed. A shut-down CP member is automatically replaced with another
available CP member in all its CP groups, including _the METADATA CP group_,
in order not to decrease or more importantly not to lose the majority of CP
groups. If there is no available CP member to replace a shutting down CP member
in a CP group, that group's size is reduced by 1 and its majority value is
recalculated. Please note that this behavior is when CP Subsystem Persistence
is disabled. When CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled, shut-down CP members are
not automatically removed from the active CP members list and they are still
considered as part of CP groups and majority calculations, because they can come
back by restoring their local CP state from stable storage. If you know that a
shut-down CP member will not be restarted, you need to remove that member from
CP Subsystem via `CPSubsystemManagementService.removeCPMember(String)`.

A new CP member can be added to CP Subsystem to either increase the number of
available CP members for new CP groups or to fill the missing slots in existing
CP groups. After the initial Hazelcast cluster startup is done, an existing
Hazelcast member can be be promoted to the CP member role. This new CP member
automatically joins to CP groups that have missing members, and majority values
of these CP groups are recalculated.

== CP Subsystem Management APIs

You can access the CP Subsystem management APIs using the Java API or REST
interface. To communicate with the REST interface there are two options; one is
to access REST endpoint URL directly or using the `hz-cluster-cp-admin` shell
script, which comes with the Hazelcast package.

NOTE: The `hz-cluster-cp-admin` script uses `curl` command, and `curl` must be
installed to be able to use the script.

* **Force Destroy a CP Group:**
+
Unconditionally destroys the given active CP group without using the Raft
algorithm mechanics. This method must be used only when a CP group loses its
majority and cannot make progress anymore. Normally, membership changes in CP
groups, such as CP member promotion or removal, are done via the Raft consensus
algorithm. However, when a CP group permanently loses its majority, it will not
be able to commit any new operation. Therefore, this method ungracefully
terminates the remaining members of the given CP group on the remaining CP
group members. It also performs a Raft commit to _the METADATA CP group_ in
order to update the status of the destroyed group. Once a CP group is
destroyed, all CP data structure proxies created before the destroy fails
with `CPGroupDestroyedException`. However, if a new proxy is created
afterwards, then this CP group is re-created from scratch with a new set of CP
members.
+
This method is idempotent. It has no effect if the given CP group is already
destroyed.

* **Remove a CP Member:**
+
Removes the given unreachable CP member from the active CP members list and all
CP groups it belongs to. If any other active CP member is available, it
replaces the removed CP member in its CP groups. Otherwise, CP groups which
the removed CP member is a member of shrinks and their majority values are
recalculated.
+
WARNING: Before removing a CP member from CP Subsystem, please make sure that
it is declared as unreachable by Hazelcast's failure detector and removed from
Hazelcast's member list. The behavior is undefined when a running CP member is
removed from CP Subsystem.

* **Promote Local Member to a CP Member**
+
Promotes the local Hazelcast member to a CP member. If the local member is already a CP member,
this method has no effect.
+
The promoted CP member will be
added to the CP groups that have missing members. A group that is missing members is one where the current size of the group is smaller than the `CPSubsystemConfig.getGroupSize()` value.

[NOTE]
====
When a member becomes a CP member, it generates an additional UUID that other CP members can use to identify it. You will see this CP UUID in the following places:

- Requests to REST endpoints in the CP group
- Responses from REST endpoints in the CP group
- Member logs
- Management Center
====

* **Wipe and Reset CP Subsystem**
+
Wipes and resets the whole CP Subsystem state and initializes it as if
the Hazelcast cluster is starting up initially. This method must be used only
when _the METADATA CP group_ loses its majority and cannot make progress
anymore.
+
After this method is called, all CP state and data are wiped and CP members
start with empty state.
+
This method can be invoked only from the Hazelcast master member, which is
the first member in the Hazelcast cluster member list. Moreover, the Hazelcast
cluster must have at least `CPSubsystemConfig.getCPMemberCount()` members.
+
This method must not be called while there are membership changes in
the Hazelcast cluster. Before calling this method, please make sure that there
is no new member joining and all existing Hazelcast members have seen the same
member list.
+
To be able to use this method, the initial CP member count of CP Subsystem,
which is defined by `CPSubsystemConfig.getCPMemberCount()`, must be satisfied.
For instance, if `CPSubsystemConfig.getCPMemberCount()` is 5 and only 1 CP
member is alive, when this method is called, 4 additional AP Hazelcast members
should exist in the cluster, or new Hazelcast members must be started.
+
This method also deletes all data written by CP Subsystem Persistence.
+
This method triggers a new CP discovery process round. However, if the new CP
discovery round fails for any reason, Hazelcast members are not terminated,
because Hazelcast members are likely to contain data for AP data structures
and their termination can cause data loss. Hence, you need to observe
the cluster and check if the CP discovery process completes successfully.
+
WARNING: This method is **NOT** idempotent and multiple invocations can break
the whole system! After calling this API, you must observe the system to see if
the reset process is successfully completed or failed before making another
call.
+
WARNING: This method deletes all CP data written by CP Subsystem Persistence.

+
* **Force Close a Session:**
+
If a Hazelcast instance that owns a CP session crashes, its CP session is not
terminated immediately. Instead, the session is closed after
`CPSubsystemConfig.getSessionTimeToLiveSeconds()` passes. If it is known for
sure that the session owner is not partitioned and definitely crashed, this
method can be used for closing the session and releasing its resources
immediately.
