= Meta-information about Mappings

You can find more information about existing mappings such as the column names and their SQL data types using the `information_schema` tables.

. Create a mapping to a map called `myMappingName`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING myMappingName
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='int');
----

. Get the name of all mappings.
+
[source,sql]
----
SHOW MAPPINGS;
----
+
You should see the name of the mapping.
+
```
+--------------------+
|name                |
+--------------------+
|myMappingName       |
+--------------------+
```

. Get more information about the mapping.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM information_schema.mappings
WHERE table_name = 'myMappingName';
----
+
The name of the mapping is stored in the `table_name` column. Currently, all mappings are part of the `public` schema in the `hazelcast` table catalog.

. Get information about the column names and the columns' SQL data types.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'myMappingName';
----
