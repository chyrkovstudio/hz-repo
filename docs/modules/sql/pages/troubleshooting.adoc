:description: This topic provides solutions to common errors in SQL queries.

{description}

== JSON_QUERY evaluated to multiple values

If you see this error, the JsonPath is returning multiple values, which results in invalid JSON. If you expect multiple values to be returned from the JsonPath, you should a wrapper, such as the `WITH CONDITIONAL ARRAY WRAPPER` clause, to wrap the values in an array.

See the xref:sql:functions-and-operators.adoc#json_query[`JSON_QUERY` reference].

== Out Of Memory Errors

If you find that your queries lead to out of memory exceptions (OOME), consider decreasing the value of the Jet engine's xref:configuration:jet-configuration.adoc#list-of-configuration-options[maxProcessorAccumulatedRecords option].
