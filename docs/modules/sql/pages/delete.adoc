= DELETE
:description: The DELETE statement deletes map entries that match the condition in a given WHERE clause.

The `DELETE` statement deletes map entries that match the condition in a given `WHERE` clause.

NOTE: This statement is not atomic. If it fails, a part of the rows might be deleted and another part might remain in the table.

== Syntax Summary

This code block is a quick reference with all the <<parameters, parameters>> that you can use with the `DELETE` statement.

See some <<examples, practical examples>>.

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM table_name [ [ AS ] alias ]
[ WHERE condition ]
----

== Parameters

The `DELETE` statement accepts the following parameters.

You must provide a `table_name` parameter.

[cols="1a,2a,1a"]
|===
|Parameter | Description | Example

|`table_name`
|The table name to delete rows from.
|<<delete-entries-by-keys-or-values>>

| `WHERE condition`
|An optional clause that, if given, indicates the conditions that rows must satisfy to be deleted. `condition` is an expression that is evaluated for each row. If the expression is `true`, the row is selected. If there's no `WHERE` clause, all rows will be deleted.
|<<delete-entries-by-keys-or-values>>

== Examples

This section lists some example SQL queries that show you how to use the `DELETE` statement.

=== Delete Entries by Keys or Values

Currently, only IMap mappings support deleting rows.

For example, in a map that contains `Employee` objects as values with the following structure:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name
| Type

|`startDate`
|`INT`

|`amount`
|`INT`

|`title`
|`STRING`

|`department`
|`STRING`
|===

You can delete the entries based on the `age` field where the age is less than 18:

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM employees WHERE age < 18;
----

Whether you can access nested fields like this in objects depends on how your map entries are serialized:

- For Java objects (xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc[`Serializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-dataserializable.adoc[`DataSerializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc#identifieddataserializable[`IdentifiedDataSerializable`]), you must xref:clusters:deploying-code-on-member.adoc[add the object's class to the classpath of the member] you are sending the query to.

- For xref:serialization:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[`Portable`] / xref:serialization:compact-serialization.adoc[`Compact(BETA)`] objects, you do not need to add the object's class to the classpath of the member, unless you want to use parameterized queries to compare one object against another.
