The `SELECT` statement reads data from tables, allowing you to query and process your data based on one or more parameters.

== Syntax Summary

This code block is a quick reference with all the <<parameters, parameters>> that you can use with the `SELECT` statement.

See some <<examples, practical examples>>.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT [ DISTINCT ] [ * | expression [ [ AS ] expression_alias ] [, ...] ]
FROM from_item [, ...]
[JOIN from_item [ ON join_condition | USING ( join_column [, ...] ) ]]
[ WHERE condition ]
[ GROUP BY { expression | expression_index } [, ...] ]
[ HAVING condition [, ...] ]
[ ORDER BY { column_name | column_position |expression } [, ...] ]
----

== Parameters

The `SELECT` statement accepts the following parameters.

You must provide an `expression` parameter and a `from_item` parameter.

[cols="1a,2a,1a"]
|===
|Parameter | Description | Example

|`DISTINCT`
|The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement returns only unique rows, ignoring any duplicates.
|<<get-columns, Get columns>>

|`expression`
|The columns to select such as names of columns or the `*` wildcard.
|<<get-columns, Get columns>>

|`from_item`
|A table expression that can be one of the following:

- `[schema_name.]table_name [ [ AS ] table_alias]`
- `(SELECT ... ) AS table_alias`
- `TABLE(function_name([ argument [, ...] ] ))`
- `(VALUES (expression, [, ...]) [, ...] )`
|<<get-columns, Get columns>>

| `JOIN`
|An optional clause that, if given, combines the results of two or more table expressions based on the values of particular columns. `JOIN` expressions (also called joins) define a data source in the `FROM` sub-clause.
|<<join-tables, Join tables>>

| `WHERE condition`
|An optional clause that, if given, indicates the conditions that rows must satisfy to be selected. `condition` is an expression that is evaluated for each row. If the expression is `true`, the row is selected. This expression is evaluated before grouping.
|<<filter-rows-by-condition, Filter rows by condition>>

| `GROUP BY expression`
|An optional clause that allows you to group results in a column by the given expression.
|<<aggregate-data, Aggregate data>>


| `HAVING condition`
|An optional filter that selects only group rows that satisfy the condition. Unlike `WHERE` filters, the `HAVING` filter is applied to group rows created by a `GROUP BY` subquery or aggregate functions such as `SUM()`.
|<<aggregate-data, Aggregate data>>

== Examples

This section lists some example SQL queries that show you how to use the `SELECT` statement.

=== Get Columns by Name

You can get columns by name, by adding them as a comma-separated list after the `SELECT` statement.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, likes FROM csv_likes;
----

```
+--------------------+------------+
|name                |       likes|
+--------------------+------------+
|Jerry               |          13|
|Greg                |         108|
|Mary                |          73|
|Jerry               |          88|
+--------------------+------------+
```

To get all columns from a table, use the `*` character.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM csv_likes;
----

```
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|          id|name                |       likes|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|           1|Jerry               |          13|
|           2|Greg                |         108|
|           3|Mary                |          73|
|           4|Jerry               |          88|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
```

=== Filter Rows by Condition

You can filter rows by using a `WHERE` clause to find columns according to a certain condition.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name FROM csv_likes WHERE likes > 20;
----

```
+--------------------+
|name                |
+--------------------+
|Greg                |
|Mary                |
|Jerry               |
+--------------------+
```

To filter rows on more than one condition, you can join conditions with the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM csv_likes
WHERE likes > 20 AND name = 'Mary';
----

```
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|          id|name                |       likes|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|           3|Mary                |          73|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
```

=== Sort and Limit Results

You can use the standard SQL clauses `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET` to sort and limit the result set of a query.

NOTE: To use these clauses on map entries, the map entries must be indexed. See xref:query:indexing-maps.adoc[].

NOTE: You cannot use these clauses in subqueries.

The following statement gets the top five employees ordered by the
`first_name` field and skips the first three results:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
    employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY first_name
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 3;
----

The following statement gets the top five employees with the highest salaries.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
    employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

=== Join Tables

You can use the standard SQL `JOIN` clause to combines rows from two or more tables, based on a related column among them.

This clause has the following limitatons:

- You cannot join two streams.

- At the moment, Hazelcast supports only `LEFT JOIN`, which returns all records from the left table as well as the matching records from the right table.

- You cannot reorder the results of a join. Tables are always joined in the order they appear in the `FROM` clause.

The following query gets the names of all employees that are managers and their departments.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    managers.department, employees.name
FROM 
    managers
JOIN employees
ON managers.manager_id = employees.employee_id
----

The following query is equivalent.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    managers.department, employees.name
FROM 
    managers, employees
WHERE managers.manager_id = employees.employee_id
----

NOTE: In these examples, the `employee` table must be a map because it's on the right side of the join.

=== Alias Columns in the Query Results

If you are returning query results to a client, you may want to give the returned columns a new name.

To alias a column in your query results, use the `AS` clause.

NOTE: This clause does not rename the column in the table.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name AS popular_users, likes
FROM csv_likes
WHERE likes > 20;
----

```
+--------------------+------------+
|popular_users       |       likes|
+--------------------+------------+
|Greg                |         108|
|Mary                |          73|
|Jerry               |          88|
+--------------------+------------+
```

=== Aggregate Data

To perform calculations on rows, use aggregate functions.

For a complete list of available aggregate functions, see xref:functions-and-operators.adoc[Functions and Operators].

To calculate the total number of likes for all names, use the `SUM()` function.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT SUM(likes) AS total_likes FROM csv_likes;
----

```
+--------------------+
|         total_likes|
+--------------------+
|                 282|
+--------------------+
```

To filter for the names that have more than 100 likes, use the `HAVING` clause, which is equivalent to the `WHERE` clause but for aggregate groups.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name AS most_liked
FROM csv_likes
GROUP BY name HAVING SUM(likes) > 100;
----

```
+--------------------+
|most_liked          |
+--------------------+
|Jerry               |
|Greg                |
+--------------------+
```

To pass a function only unique values, use the `DISTINCT` operator.

NOTE: This operator is ignored in `MIN`/`MAX` functions.

This query calculates the number of distinct colors of cars in a table.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT color)
FROM cars
----

=== Generate Data

To generate data and make it available as a table that you can use in your own statements, use xref:functions-and-operators.adoc#table-valued-functions[table-valued functions].

To generate a table with numbers 1 to 3, use the `TABLE(generate_series())` table expression.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM TABLE(generate_series(1,3));
----

```
+------------+
|           v|
+------------+
|           1|
|           2|
|           3|
+------------+
```

To generate a stream of data, use the `TABLE(generate_stream())` table expression. This example generates 100 numbers per second, starting from 0 and displays only multiples of 10 in the results.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM TABLE(generate_stream(100))
WHERE v / 10 * 10 = v;
----
