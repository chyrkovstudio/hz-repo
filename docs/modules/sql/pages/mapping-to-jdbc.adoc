= Mapping to JDBC
:description: To query external JDBC data stores, you can create a mapping to them with the JDBC connector.

== What is the JDBC Connector

The JDBC connector allows you to connect to any database that supports the JDBC interface.

== Supported SQL Statements

The JDBC connector supports only the following statements:

- xref:select.adoc[`SELECT`]
- xref:sink-into.adoc[`INSERT INTO`]
- xref:update.adoc[`UPDATE`]
- xref:delete.adoc[`DELETE`]





== Installing the Connector

The JDBC connector is included in the full and slim distributions of Hazelcast.

== Permissions
[.enterprise]*Enterprise*

The JDBC connector does not yet support permissions.

== Before you Begin

Before you can create a mapping to an external data store, you must have the following:

- A JDBC driver that's compatible with your data store. This driver must be on the classpath of your cluster members:
** The full distribution of  Hazelcast Enterprise comes with a JDBC driver for PostgreSQL data stores only.
** The slim distribution of Hazelcast does not come with a JDBC driver.
** The full distribution of Hazelcast Open Source comes with a JDBC driver for MySQL and PostgreSQL data stores.
- A xref:external-data-stores:external-data-stores.adoc[data store connection] that's configured on all cluster members.
- Create the database that you'll use as your external data store.

== Creating a JDBC Mapping

The following example creates a mapping to a MySQL database.

In the MySQL database, create a `people` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100))
```

Use the `CREATE MAPPING` statement to tell the JDBC connector the name of your data store configuration.

```yaml
external-data-store:
  mysql-database: <1>
    class-name: com.hazelcast.datastore.JdbcDataStoreFactory
    properties:
      jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://dummy:3306
      username: xyz
      password: xyz
    shared: true
```
<1> Configuration details for a MySQL database.

Create the mapping.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING people
TYPE JDBC <1>
OPTIONS ( 
  'externalDataStoreRef'='mysql-database' <2>
)
```

<1> The name of the connector.
<2> The name of the external data store configuration on your members.
