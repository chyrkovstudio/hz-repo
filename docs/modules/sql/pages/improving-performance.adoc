== Displaying the Execution Plan

Add the keyword `EXPLAIN` in front of your query. For example:

[source,sql]
----
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE age > ?;
----

Scanning an entire table (full table scans) is the slowest way to access data, if you are filtering just a small subset of rows. If your queries are performing full table scans on a map, you can create indexes that contain at least one of the columns that the query is filtering in its `WHERE` clause. See xref:create-index.adoc[].
