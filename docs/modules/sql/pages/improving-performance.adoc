== Finding Slow Queries

Scanning an entire table is the slowest way to access data. You can find out if your queries are performing full table scans, using the `EXPLAIN` statement.

If your queries are performing full table scans, you should create indexes that contain at least one of the columns that the query is filtering in its `WHERE` clause. See xref:create-index.adoc[].

== Improving Query Performance for Maps

You can improve the performance of queries over maps by indexing map entries.

To find out more about indexing map entries, see xref:query:indexing-maps.adoc[].
