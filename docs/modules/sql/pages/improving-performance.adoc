== Finding Slow Queries

Scanning an entire table (full table scans) is the slowest way to access data. You can find out if your queries are performing full table scans, using the `EXPLAIN` statement.

If your queries are performing full table scans on a map, you should create indexes that contain at least one of the columns that the query is filtering in its `WHERE` clause. See xref:create-index.adoc[].
