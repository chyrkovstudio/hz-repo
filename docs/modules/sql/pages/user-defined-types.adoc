= User-Defined Types in SQL

User-Defined Types (also known as UDTs, nested types, or nested fields) is an experimental feature that allows you to create
 custom data types that can be referenced in the xref:sql:create-mapping.adoc[CREATE MAPPING statement].

UDTs are useful for creating and accessing hierarchical data structures, including simple cases of nested objects and
more complex cases of fully/partially connected graphs of objects. See <<queryingExamples,examples>> for more information.

WARNING: Support for UDTs is an experimental feature, and disabled by default.
See <<enabling-udt-support, Enabling UDT support>> to learn how to enable it.

== Feature Overview

Due to the experimental nature of UDTs, the feature set is limited to the following:

- Support for three formats - `portable`, `compact` and `java` with varying level of sub-feature support
- Instance and type-level cycles are only supported for Java types.
- Type formats (referred to as type kind or kind hereafter) can not be mixed, both between mappings and types themselves.
For example, you cannot use Java type in another Portable type or Portable mapping.
- Limited support for instance and type-level cycles; only for Java types.
Note that INSERT/UPDATE are disabled for mappings that use type hierarchies that contain cycles.
- Limited support for `INSERT` and `UPDATE` queries for mappings using UDTs; if a `TYPE` hierarchy contains cycles,
`INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements are disabled for the mapping.
- Support for using UDT-based projections in both normal `SELECT` projection lists, `WHERE` filters and in `JOIN` conditions.

== Enabling UDT Support
You can enable UDTs by setting the `hazelcast.sql.experimental.custom.types.enabled` property to `true` in the member configuration.

== Creating Types

To create a new type, use the `CREATE TYPE` statement:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TYPE [IF NOT EXISTS] MyTypeName
    [(colName colType, ...)]
    OPTIONS (
    'format'='{java|portable|compact}'
    [, 'javaClass'='com.myPackage.MyJavaClass'] <1>
    [, 'compactTypeName'='MyCompactRecordTypeName'] <2>
    [, 'portableFactoryId'='123', 'portableClassId'='456', ['portableVersion'='789']] <3>
    )
----
<1> `java` format requires the `javaClass` option.
<2> `portable` format requires `portableFactoryId` and `portableClassId` and optionally `portableVersion`.
<3> `compact` format requires `compactTypeName` - this is not the name of the created type, but rather internal name of the Compact record type, used internally by the Compact Serialization format.

NOTE: To reference another type, you must provide the column list. Otherwise, the column may be automatically resolved as an `OBJECT` type.

=== Java Format notes
For `java` format, if the column list is omitted, it will be automatically resolved from the corresponding
Java class. Note that the column list will only be extracted from the source class itself;
if it has columns that are inherited from a superclass, these columns will not be resolved.

=== Portable Format notes
When using the `portable` format, make sure that the `factoryId`, `classId`, and `version` tuples are unique within the cluster.
Otherwise, deserialization issues can happen if the corresponding class IDs and factory IDs are registered in the client
for serialization/deserialization.

In addition, there is a rudimentary auto-resolution mechanism for column list. However, it is not recommended for use:
it relies on the Portable class being already registered (through internal Portable means,
e.g., when a configuration for Portable serialization is added) on the member executing the above SQL command.
This mechanism is not reliable since this command will fail if the member that executes the command doesn't have
the Portable class in question. Therefore, it is recommended to always specify the column list.

=== Support for Cycles
Cycles between types are only supported for Java format however, the support is limited to querying only.
If a Type hierarchy contains cycles, any mapping using any of these types (provided that type is not itself an acyclic branch)
will have `INSERT` and `UPDATE` commands disabled.
Additionally, support for cycles also means no validation for existence of custom types at the time of `CREATE TYPE` execution.
**Type hierarchies are only verified for consistency upon actual use in `CREATE MAPPING`.**

=== Replacing Types and Type Consistency
Currently, there is a limitation on the replacement of existing types:
if the replaced type was already used in a mapping, you need to fully replace that mapping
to update its data type information using the `DROP MAPPING` and `CREATE MAPPING` statements.
However, if the type hierarchy was not used in a mapping, any type in that hierarchy can be safely
changed, and these changes will appear in the new mapping. This is because the links
between types are symbolic (based on the name only), and they're only "materialized" once used in a mapping.

=== CREATE TYPE Examples

NOTE: `EXTERNAL NAME` aliases are not supported for types, column names have to have exact
same name as their corresponding Java/Portable/Compact class fields.

Java Type with auto-resolution for columns:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TYPE MyType OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'javaClass'='com.example.MyJavaClass'
)
----

Java type with explicit columns:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TYPE MyType (
    id BIGINT,
    name VARCHAR,
    other MyOtherType
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'javaClass'='com.example.MyJavaClass'
)
----

Portable Type:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TYPE MyPortableType (
    id BIGINT,
    name VARCHAR
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'portableFactoryId'='1',
    'portableClassId'='1'
    -- 'portableVersion'='0' - specified by default
)
----

Compact Type:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TYPE MyCompactType (
   id BIGINT,
   name VARCHAR
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'compactTypeName'='MyCompactTypeInternalCompactNameExample',
)
----

==== Creating Java Type Hierarchy with Cycles

Java classes for reference:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;

class A implements Serializable {
    public String name;
    public B b;
}
class B implements Serializable {
    public String name;
    public C c;
}
class C implements Serializable {
    public String name;
    public A a;
}
----

The following commands will create an interlinked type hierarchy:

NOTE: Order of execution of these commands doesn't matter.

===== Cyclic Type Hierarchy [[cyclicTypeDefinitions]]
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TYPE AType (
    name VARCHAR,
    b BType
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'javaClass'='com.example.A'
);

CREATE TYPE BType (
    name VARCHAR,
    c CType
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'javaClass'='com.example.B'
);

CREATE TYPE CType (
    name VARCHAR,
    a AType
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'javaClass'='com.example.C'
);
----

== Creating Mappings with UDT Columns

The syntax of the `CREATE MAPPING` statement is virtually unchanged, except now, UDT names can be used
in the column type.

NOTE: UDT columns must be explicitly declared as of UDT type in the column list, even if the underlying
Java class of the column is registered as a backing Java class for an existing UDT.
Otherwise, the column in question will be auto-resolved as `OBJECT`.

=== Java Class Hierarchy for Reference:
The following classes will be used as a reference in the following sections to create types and mappings

[source,java]
----
package com.example;

class User implements Serializable {
    public Long id;
    public String name;
    public Organization organization;
}

class Organization implements Serializable {
    public Long id;
    public String name;
    public Office office;
}

class Office implements Serializable {
    public Long id;
    public String name;
}
----

=== Creating Types[[normalTypeDefinitions]]

NOTE: The `Type` suffix in the Type Names below is just for convenience. Types can have the same name
as their Java/Portable/Compact class, and are otherwise not limited naming-wise. The only limitation is that the
types must have distinct names within the set of names of all mappings and views as they
all share the same name space.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TYPE OrganizationType (
    id BIGINT
    name VARCHAR,
    office OfficeType
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'javaClass'='com.example.Organization'
);

CREATE TYPE OfficeType (
    id BIGINT
    name VARCHAR
) OPTIONS (
    'format'='java',
    'javaClass'='com.example.Office'
);
----

=== Creating Mappings

NOTE: The `organization` column is explicitly specified as `OrganizationType`. Without this definition, it would be
auto-resolved as generic `OBJECT`, and would not allow querying its sub-columns.

==== Normal Type Hierarchy [[normalMappings]]

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING users (
    __key BIGINT,
    id BIGINT,
    name VARCHAR,
    organization OrganizationType
) TYPE IMap OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat'='bigint',
    'valueFormat'='java',
    'valueJavaClass'='com.example.User'
);
----

==== Using Types from Cyclic Type Hierarchy [[cylicMappings]]

Using type hierarchy from the <<cyclicTypeDefinitions, cyclic types example>>, all the following
mappings will work.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING tableA (
    __key BIGINT,
    name VARCHAR,
    b BType
) OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat'='bigint',
    'valueFormat'='java',
    'valueJavaClass'='com.example.A'
);

CREATE MAPPING tableB (
    __key BIGINT,
    name VARCHAR,
    c CType
) OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat'='bigint',
    'valueFormat'='java',
    'valueJavaClass'='com.example.B'
);

CREATE MAPPING tableC (
    __key BIGINT,
    name VARCHAR,
    a AType
) OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat'='bigint',
    'valueFormat'='java',
    'valueJavaClass'='com.example.C'
);
----

== Querying Support

Querying is provided with the field access operator which has the following syntax:
[source,sql]
----
(<mappingColumn>).typeAColumn.typeBColumn.typeCColumn
----

`mappingColumn` must be the top-level column inside a mapping that has a UDT as its type,
whereas `typeACOlumn`,`typeBColumn` and `typeCColumn` are all columns within the UDTs.

NOTE: The `mappingColumn` type must have the `typeACOlumn`,`typeBColumn` and `typeCColumn` columns defined in the `CREATE TYPE` command
or at least auto-resolved (Java types only). Otherwise, the query fails even if the underlying object
contains fields with these names.

=== Examples[[queryingExamples]]

==== Non-cyclic Type Hierarchy Querying

Following examples use <<normalTypeDefinitions, normal type definitions>> and <<normalMappings, normal mappings>>.

Basic querying:
[source,sql]
----
SELECT (organization).office.name FROM users
----

Selecting whole sub-object:
[source,sql]
----
SELECT (organization).office FROM users
----

NOTE: When selecting the entire object, the query will always try to return the underlying object verbatim.
For Java Types, this means returning an underlying Java class instance, which can fail with a `ClassNotFoundException`
if the class is not in the classpath of the client (or embedded server) JVM.
A way to avoid this is to select field by field instead. Additionally, this issue is not relevant for Compact
and Portable types as sub-objects in these mappings and types are of `GenericRecord` subclass;
`PortableGenericRecord` and `CompactGenericRecord` are present in the base distribution of Hazelcast.

Using projections:
[source,sql]
----
SELECT (organization).id * 1000, ABS((organization).office.id) FROM users
----
Projections work as usual as field access expressions have virtually same semantics and possible usage contexts as normal
column projections.

==== Cyclic Type Hierarchy Querying

Following examples use <<cyclicTypeDefinitions, cyclic type definitions>> and following mapping:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;

class Wrapper {
    public A root;
}
----

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING test (
    __key BIGINT,
    root AType
) TYPE IMap OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat'='bigint',
    'valueFormat'='java',
    'valueJavaClass'='com.example.Wrapper'
)
----


Assuming following data is present in the table:

*Test table content*
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|__key BIGINT|root AType

| 1
| <a1>

| 2
| <a2>

|===

*A-instances* [[cyclicObjectInstances]]

A1

[source,java]
----
// Cyclic structure where C1 references the root - A1.
// A1 -> B1 -> C1 -> [A1]
final A a1 = new A();
a1.b = new B();
a1.b.c = new C();
// loop back to A1
a1.b.c.a = a1;

a1.name = "A1";
a1.b.name = "B1";
a1.b.c.name = "C1";
----

A2

[source,java]
----
// Cyclic structure with additional chain with loop back to A2.
// A2 -> B2 -> C2 -> A3 -> C3 -> [A2]
final A a2 = new A();
a2.b = new B();
a2.b.c = new C();
a2.b.c.a = new A();
a2.b.c.a.b = new B();
a2.b.c.a.b.c = new C();
// loop back to A2
a2.b.c.a.b.c.a = a2;

a2.name = "A2";
a2.b.name = "B2";
a2.b.c.name = "C2";
a2.b.c.a.name = "A3";
a2.b.c.a.b.name = "B3"
a2.b.c.a.b.c.name = "C3"
----

*Examples:*

Basic Query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    (root).name AS v1,
    (root).b.name AS v2,
    (root).b.c.name AS v3,
    (root).b.c.a.name AS v4
FROM test
WHERE __key = 1
----

Result:
[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|v1 VARCHAR|v2 VARCHAR|v3 VARCHAR|v4 VARCHAR

|'A1'
|'B1'
|'C1'
|'A1'

|===

Multiple Iteration Loop back through Cycle:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    (root).b.c.a.b.c.a.b.c.a.b AS v1,
FROM test
WHERE __key = 1
----

Result:
[cols="1"]
|===
|v1 VARCHAR

|'B1'

|===

Accessing additional cyclic chain:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    (root).b.c.a.name AS v1,
    (root).b.c.a.b.name AS v2,
    (root).b.c.a.b.c.name AS v3,
    (root).b.c.a.b.c.a.name AS v4
FROM test
WHERE __key = 2
----

Result:
[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|v1 VARCHAR|v2 VARCHAR|v3 VARCHAR|v4 VARCHAR

|'A3'
|'B3'
|'C3'
|'A2'
|===

== `INSERT` and `UPDATE` Support

INSERT and UPDATE queries are supported in a limited way, specifically:

- `INSERT` and `UPDATE` queries are only supported for non-cyclic type hierarchies. Presence of a cycle
in a type hierarchy automatically disables the ability to run these queries against any MAPPING that uses UDTs
from that type hierarchy. However, it's still possible to use an acyclic branch of a type hierarchy
even if that branch is used in a cyclic type hierarchy.
- `INSERT` queries require specifying the full list of columns even if the column of a nested type needs to be set to `NULL`.
- `UPDATE` queries only work on the root column and also require the full list of columns and sub-columns to work.
Updating sub-columns is technically possible by specifying column projections in place of sub-columns that shouldn't be changed.
- Both `UPDATE` and `INSERT` work through the usage of Row Value expression (which is similar to VALUES clause of INSERT).

=== Examples[[upsertExamples]]

Following examples use <<normalTypeDefinitions, normal type definitions>> and <<normalMappings, normal mappings>>.

NOTE: The order of column values is identical to the order of columns specified when executing the underlying `CREATE MAPPING` and `CREATE TYPE` statements.

Basic Insert of UDT-column:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'testUser', (1, 'organization1', (1, 'office1')))
----

Skipping initialization of certain columns:

`(organization).name` and `(organization).office.id` are `null` in this example.

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'testUser', (1, null, (null, 'office1')))
----

Replacing whole column:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE users SET organization = (2, 'organization2', (2, 'office2'))
----

Replacing nested column value:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE users SET organization = ((organization).id, (organization).name, ((organization).office.id, 'new-office-name'))
----

NOTE: Updating UDT-based columns requires providing a value for every column in the UDT and its child UDTs, however
`null` can also be specified in place of nested UDT column to initialize it to `null`. Not providing full list of columns
will cause a query validation error.

Inserting with Query Parameter (java only):

[source,java]
----
final Office office = new Office();
office.id = 1L;
office.name = "office1";

final Organization organization = new Organization();
organization.id = 1L;
organization.name = "organization1";
organization.office = office;

hz.getSql().execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'user1', ?)", organization);
----

Updating with Query Parameter:

Using `organization` from the example above.

[source,java]
----
hz.getSql().execute("UPDATE users SET organization = ?", organization);
----

Updating nested UDT column with Query Parameter:

[source,java]
----
hz.getSql().execute("UPDATE users SET organization = ((organization).id, (organization).name, ?)", office);
----
