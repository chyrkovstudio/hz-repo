= UPDATE
:description: The UPDATE statement overwrites the values of map entries that match the condition in a given WHERE clause.

The `UPDATE` statement overwrites the values of map entries that match the condition in a given `WHERE` clause. However, you cannot update keys in map entries.

NOTE: This statement is not atomic. If it fails, a part of the rows might be updated and another part might remain unchanged.

== Syntax Summary

This code block is a quick reference with all the <<parameters, parameters>> that you can use with the `UPDATE` statement.

See some <<examples, practical examples>>.

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE table_name [ [ AS ] alias ]
SET { column_name = expression } [, ...]
[ WHERE condition ]
----

== Parameters

The `UPDATE` statement accepts the following required parameters.

[cols="1a,2a,1a"]
|===
|Parameter | Description | Example

|`column_name`
|The name of column to set value for.
|<<update-columns-by-name, Update Columns by Name>>

|`expression`
|The value to assign. Can be a literal, parameter, or an expression from other column's values.
|<<update-columns-by-name, Update Columns by Name>>


| `WHERE condition`
|An optional clause that, if given, indicates the conditions that rows must satisfy to be updated. `condition` is an expression that is evaluated for each row. If the expression is `true`, the row is selected. If there's no `WHERE` clause, all rows are updated.
|<<update-columns-by-name, Update Columns by Name>>
|===

== Examples

This section lists some example SQL queries that show you how to use the `UPDATE` statement.

=== Update Columns by Name

You can overwrite the values in columns by name, using the `SET` clause.

For example, in a map that contains `Employee` objects as values with the following structure:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name
| Type

|`startDate`
|`INT`

|`amount`
|`INT`

|`title`
|`VARCHAR`

|`department`
|`VARCHAR`
|===

You can update the values of the `Employee.department` field:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE employees
SET department = 'engineering'
WHERE title LIKE '%developer%';
----

Whether you can access nested fields like this in objects depends on how your map entries are serialized:

- For Java objects (xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc[`Serializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-dataserializable.adoc[`DataSerializable`], xref:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc#identifieddataserializable[`IdentifiedDataSerializable`]), you must xref:clusters:deploying-code-on-member.adoc[add the object's class to the classpath of the member] you are sending the query to.

- For xref:serialization:implementing-portable-serialization.adoc[`Portable`] / xref:serialization:compact-serialization.adoc[`Compact`] objects, you do not need to add the object's class to the classpath of the member, unless you want to use parameterized queries to compare one object against another.
