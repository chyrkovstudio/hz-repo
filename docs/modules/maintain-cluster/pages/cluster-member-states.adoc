= Cluster and Member States
[[managing-cluster-and-member-states]]

This section explains the states of Hazelcast clusters and members which
you can use to allow or restrict the designated cluster/member operations.

== Cluster States

By changing the state of your cluster, you can grant or restrict several
cluster operations as well as change the behavior of those operations.

To change your cluster's state, you can use the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cluster/Cluster.html[`changeClusterState()` and `shutdown()` methods] or use the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#cluster-state[Management Center].

Hazelcast clusters have the following states:

* **`ACTIVE`**: This is the default cluster state. Cluster continues to operate without restrictions.
* **`NO_MIGRATION`**:
** In this state, there is no data movement between Hazelcast members.
It means that when there is a member crash or a new member in the cluster,
there wonâ€™t be any partition rebalancing, partition backup replica creation
or migration.
+
Please note that promoting a backup replica to the primary replica is a
local operation and does not involve any data movement between cluster members.
Hence, backup promotions occur on member crashes when the cluster is in this mode.
Upon a member crash, all other members that keep backup replicas of the crashed member
promote backup replicas to the primary replica role and restore availability.
However, there is a limitation here. Since the maximum number of backups is 6,
if you lose 7 members in your large cluster, you can lose availability of the
partitions whose primary and backup replicas are mapped to those crashed members.
+
** The cluster accepts new members.
** All other operations are allowed.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `NO_MIGRATION` when
migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** When you want to add multiple new members to the cluster, you can first
change the cluster state to `NO_MIGRATION`, then start the new members.
Once all them join to the cluster, you can change the cluster state back to `ACTIVE`.
Then, the cluster rebalances partition replica distribution at once.
* **`FROZEN`**:
** In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed.
** The cluster does not accept new members.
** If a member leaves, it can join back. Its partition assignments
(both primary and backup replicas) remain the same until either it joins back or
the cluster state is changed to `ACTIVE`. When it joins back to the cluster,
it owns all previous partition assignments as it was. On the other hand,
when the cluster state changes to `ACTIVE`, re-partitioning starts and
unassigned partition replicas are assigned to the active members.
** All other operations in the cluster, except migration, continue without restrictions.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `FROZEN` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** You can make use of `FROZEN` state along with the xref:storage:persistence.adoc[Persistence]
feature. You can change the cluster state to `FROZEN`, then restart some of your members using
the Persistence feature. The data on the restarting members will not be accessible but
you will be able to access to the data that is stored in other members.
Basically, `FROZEN` cluster state allows you do perform maintenance on your members with degrading availability partially.
* **`PASSIVE`**:
** In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed.
** The cluster does not accept new members.
** If a member leaves while the cluster is in this state, the member will be
removed from the partition table if cluster state moves back to `ACTIVE`.
** This state rejects ALL operations immediately EXCEPT the read-only operations like
`map.get()` and `cache.get()`, replication and cluster heartbeat tasks.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `PASSIVE` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** You can make use of `PASSIVE` state along with the xref:storage:persistence.adoc[Persistence]
feature. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cluster/Cluster.html#shutdown--[Cluster Shutdown API^]
for more info.
* **`IN_TRANSITION`**:
** This state shows that the state of the cluster is in transition.
** You cannot set your cluster's state as `IN_TRANSITION` explicitly.
** It is a temporary and intermediate state.
** During this state, your cluster does not accept new members and migration/replication tasks are paused.

NOTE: All in-cluster methods are fail-fast, i.e., when a method fails in the cluster,
it throws an exception immediately (it is not retried): when there is an error during a state transition,
that error is propagated immediately, Hazelcast does not attempt to retry the transition in this case.

The following snippet is from the `Cluster` interface showing
the methods used to manage your cluster's states.

[source,java]
----
public interface Cluster {
    ClusterState getClusterState();
    void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState);
    void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState, TransactionOptions transactionOptions);
    void shutdown();
    void shutdown(TransactionOptions transactionOptions);
}

See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cluster/Cluster.html[Cluster interface Javadoc^] for information about these methods.

== Cluster Member States

Hazelcast cluster members have the following states:

* **`ACTIVE`**: This is the initial member state. The member can execute and process
all operations. When the state of the cluster is `ACTIVE` or `FROZEN`, the members are in the `ACTIVE` state.
* **`PASSIVE`**: In this state, member rejects all operations EXCEPT the read-only ones,
replication and migration operations, heartbeat operations and the join operations as explained
in the <<cluster-states, Cluster States section>> above.
A member can go into this state when either of the following happens:
. Until the member's shutdown process is completed after the method `Node.shutdown(boolean)` is called.
Note that, when the shutdown process is completed, member's state changes to `SHUT_DOWN`.
. Cluster's state is changed to `PASSIVE` using the method `changeClusterState()`.
* **`SHUT_DOWN`**: A member goes into this state when the member's shutdown process is completed.
The member in this state rejects all operations and invocations. A member in this state cannot be restarted.
