= Shutting Down the Cluster
:description:

== Safety Checking Cluster Members

To prevent data loss when shutting down a cluster member, Hazelcast provides
a graceful shutdown feature. You perform this shutdown by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.

The oldest cluster member migrates all the replicas owned by
the shutdown-requesting member to the other running (not initiated shutdown) cluster members.
After these migrations are completed, the shutting down member will not be the owner or
a backup of any partition anymore. It means that you can shutdown any number of Hazelcast members
in a cluster concurrently with no data loss.

Please note that the process of shutting down members waits for
a predefined amount of time for the oldest member to migrate their partition replicas.
You can specify this graceful shutdown timeout duration using the property `hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait`.
Its default value is 10 minutes. If migrations are not completed within this duration,
shutdown may continue non-gracefully and lead to data loss.
Therefore, you should choose your own timeout duration considering the size of data in your cluster.

=== Ensuring Safe State with PartitionService

With the improvements in graceful shutdown procedure in previous Hazelcast releases,
the following methods are not needed to perform graceful shutdown.
Nevertheless, you can use them to check the current safety status of the partitions in your cluster.

[source,java]
----
public interface PartitionService {
   ...
   ...
    boolean isClusterSafe();
    boolean isMemberSafe(Member member);
    boolean isLocalMemberSafe();
    boolean forceLocalMemberToBeSafe(long timeout, TimeUnit unit);
}
----

The method `isClusterSafe` checks whether the cluster is in a safe state.
It returns `true` if there are no active partition migrations and all backups are in sync for each partition.

The method `isMemberSafe` checks whether a specific member is in a safe state.
It checks if all backups of partitions of the given member are in sync with the primary ones.
Once it returns `true`, the given member is safe and it can be shut down without data loss.

Similarly, the method `isLocalMemberSafe` does the same check for the local member.
The method `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe` forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized,
making the local member safe.

See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/monitoring/cluster-safety[here^]
for more `PartitionService` code samples.

== Shutting Down a Hazelcast Cluster

**Using the cluster.sh script:**

To shutdown the cluster, use the following command:

[source,plain]
----
./cluster.sh -o shutdown -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test
----

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:

[source,plain]
----
./cluster.sh --operation shutdown --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --clustername test --password test
----

**Using the REST API:**

To shutdown the cluster, use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
curl --data "${CLUSTERNAME}&$\{PASSWORD}"  http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/hazelcast/rest/management/cluster/clusterShutdown
----

== Safely Shutting Down for Lossless Restart

For lossless restart to work the cluster must be shut down gracefully.
When members are shutdown one by one in a rapid succession, Hazelcast triggers
an automatic rebalancing process where backup partitions are promoted
and new backups are created for each member. This may result in
out-of-memory errors or data loss.

The entire cluster can be shut down using the `hz-cluster-admin`
command line tool.

```bash
bin/hz-cluster-admin -a <address> -c <cluster-name> -o shutdown
```

For the command line tool to work, REST should be enabled in
`hazelcast.yaml`:

```yaml
hazelcast:
  network:
    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        CLUSTER_READ:
          enabled: true
        CLUSTER_WRITE:
          enabled: true
        HEALTH_CHECK:
          enabled: true
        HOT_RESTART:
          enabled: true
```

Alternatively, you can shutdown the cluster using the Hazelcast
Management Center:

Since the Persistence data is saved locally on each member, all the
members must be present after the restart for Hazelcast to be able to reload
the data. Beyond that, thereâ€™s no special action to take: as soon as the
cluster re-forms, it will automatically reload the persisted snapshots
and resume the jobs.

== Shutting Down a Hazelcast Member

The following are the ways of shutting down a Hazelcast member:

* You can call `kill -9 <PID>` in the terminal (which sends a SIGKILL signal).
This results in the immediate shutdown which is not recommended for production systems.
If you set the property `hazelcast.shutdownhook.enabled` to `false` and then kill the process using `kill -15 <PID>`, its result is the same (immediate shutdown).
* You can call `kill -15 <PID>` in the terminal (which sends a SIGTERM signal), or you can call
the method `HazelcastInstance.getLifecycleService().terminate()` programmatically, or you can use
the script `stop.sh` located in your Hazelcast's `/bin` directory. All three of them terminate your member ungracefully.
They do not wait for migration operations, they force the shutdown.
But this is much better than `kill -9 <PID>` since it releases most of the used resources.
* In order to gracefully shutdown a Hazelcast member (so that it waits the migration operations to be completed), you have four options:
** You can call the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()` programatically.
** You can use JMX API's shutdown method. You can do this by implementing
a JMX client application or using a JMX monitoring tool (like JConsole).
** You can set the property `hazelcast.shutdownhook.policy` to `GRACEFUL` and then shutdown by using `kill -15 <PID>`.
Your member will be gracefully shutdown.
** You can use the "Shutdown Member" button in the member view of
xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-members.adoc[Management Center].

If you use systemd's `systemctl` utility, i.e., `systemctl stop service_name`, a SIGTERM signal is sent.
After 90 seconds of waiting it is followed by a SIGKILL signal by default.
Thus, it calls terminate at first and kill the member directly after 90 seconds.
We do not recommend to use it with its defaults. But
https://www.linux.com/learn/understanding-and-using-systemd[systemd^] is very customizable and
well-documented, you can see its details using the command  `man systemd.kill`.
If you can customize it to shutdown your Hazelcast member gracefully (by using the methods above), then you can use it.


== Using Management Center

You can also use Hazelcast Management Center to shutdown
your Hazelcast cluster. See the xref:{page-latest-supported-mc}@management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#cluster-state[Cluster State section] in the Hazelcast Management Center documentation.
