= Comparing Serialization Interfaces

The table below provides a comparison between the interfaces listed in the previous section
to help you in deciding which interface to use in your applications.

[cols="3,3a,4a"]
|===
| Serialization Interface| Advantages| Disadvantages

| Serializable
| * A standard and basic Java interface

* Requires no implementation
| * More time and CPU usage

* More space occupancy

* Not supported by Native clients

| Externalizable
| * A standard Java interface

* More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable
| * Serialization interface must be implemented

* Not supported by Native clients

| DataSerializable
| * More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable
| * Specific to Hazelcast

*  Not supported by Native clients

| IdentifiedDataSerializable
| * More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable

* Reflection is not used during deserialization

* Supported by all Native Clients
| * Specific to Hazelcast

* Serialization interface must be implemented

* A Factory and configuration must be implemented

| Portable
| * More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable

* Reflection is not used during deserialization

* Versioning is supported

* Partial deserialization is supported during Queries

* Supported by all Native Clients
| * Specific to Hazelcast

* Serialization interface must be implemented

* A Factory and configuration must be implemented

* Class definition is also sent with data but stored only once per class

| Custom Serialization
| * Does not require class to implement an interface

* Convenient and flexible

* Can be based on StreamSerializer ByteArraySerializer
|* Serialization interface must be implemented

* Plug in and configuration is required

| Compact Serialization (BETA)
| * More memory usage efficient than Portable

* Convenient, flexible, and can be used with no configuration

* Does not require class to implement an interface

* Supports schema evolution

* Partial deserialization is supported during queries and indexing

|* Specific to Hazelcast

* Schema is not part of the data but schema distribution
may incur costs on short-lived use cases

* The format is in the BETA state and no compatibility
guarantees are given yet
