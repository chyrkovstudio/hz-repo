= Compact Serialization
:page-beta: true

As an enhancement to existing serialization methods, Hazelcast offers a BETA version
of the Compact serialization, with the following main features.

* Separates the schema from the data and stores it per type, not per object which
results in less memory and bandwidth usage compared to other formats
* Does not require a class to implement an interface or change the source code of
the class in any way
* Supports schema evolution which permits adding or removing fields, or changing
the types of fields
* Can work with no configuration or any kind of factory/serializer registration
* Platform and language independent
* Supports partial deserialization of fields, without deserializing the whole objects during
queries or indexing

Hazelcast achieves these features by having a well-known schema of objects and replicating
them across the cluster which enables members and clients to fetch schemas they don't
have in their local registries. Each serialized object carries just a schema identifier and
relies on the schema distribution service or configuration to match identifiers with the
actual schema. Once the schemas are fetched, they are cached locally on the members and clients
so that the next operations that use the schema do not incur extra costs.

Schemas help Hazelcast to identify the locations of the fields on the serialized binary data.
With this information, Hazelcast can deserialize individual fields of the data, without reading
the whole binary. This results in a better query and indexing performance.

Schemas can evolve freely by adding or removing fields. Even, the types of the fields can be changed.
Multiple versions of the schema may live in the same cluster and both the old and new readers
may read the compatible parts of the data. This feature is especially useful in rolling upgrade
scenarios.

The Compact serialization does not require any changes in the user classes as it doesn't need
a class to implement a particular interface. Serializers might be implemented and registered
separately from the classes.

It also supports zero-configuration use cases by automatically extracting schemas out of the
classes using reflection, which is cached and reused later, with no extra cost.

The underlying format of the compact serialized objects is platform and language independent.
Native client supports will be added shortly after promoting this feature to stable status.

Note that, currently, the feature is in BETA state and Hazelcast does not guarantee behavior or API
compatibility.

During the BETA period, Compact serialization has to be enabled explicitly as shown in the
<<compactserializationconfig, CompactSerializationConfig section>>.

== Using Compact Serialization With Zero-Configuration

Compact Serialization can be used without a configuration or serializer
registration. As described in the xref:interface-types.adoc[Serialization Interface Types],
Hazelcast tries to find a serializer for any object. Before this feature, if
there were no serializers associated with a certain class, we were throwing an
exception indicating that there is no suitable serializer for it. Now, as
a last effort, Hazelcast tries to use Compact serialization. To do this, Hazelcast tries
to extract a schema out of the class using reflection. If successful, it registers the
reflective serializer associated with the extracted schema and uses it while
serializing/deserializing instances of that class. If the automatic schema
extraction fails, Hazelcast throws an exception as before.

Currently, Hazelcast supports extracting schemas out of the classes that have the following
field types.

* Primitive types: `boolean`, `byte`, `short`, `char`, `integer`, `long`, `float`, and `double`.
* `String`
* `java.time.LocalDate`, `java.time.LocalTime`, `java.time.LocalDateTime`, and `java.time.OffsetDateTime`
* `java.math.BigDecimal`
* Arrays of the types shown above
* Nested classes that contain the fields above and arrays of them

Assume that we have the following `Employee` class.

[source,java]
----
public class Employee {
    private long id;
    private String name;

    public Employee() {
    }

    public Employee(long id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
----

If we don't perform any kind of configuration change and use the instances of the class
directly, there won't be any exceptions thrown. Hazelcast will generate a schema out of the
`Employee` class the first time we try to serialize an object, cache it, and reuse it
for the subsequent serializations/deserializations.

For reflective schema extraction and serializer to work, the class must have an empty
public constructor.

[source,java]
----
ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
config.getSerializationConfig()
        .getCompactSerializationConfig()
        .setEnabled(true); // Required during BETA

HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(config);
IMap<Long, Employee> map = client.getMap("employees");
Employee employee = new Employee(1, "John Doe");
map.set(1L, employee);
Employee employeeFromMap = map.get(1L);
----

NOTE: Since the Compact Serialization feature is in BETA, to use zero-configuration, ironically,
you have to enable it with the `CompactSerializationConfig` as shown below. This limitation will
be removed once the BETA period ends, and Hazelcast will enable Compact serialization by default.
Once this happens, zero-configuration will work as promised, without requiring any kind of
configuration.

== Implementing CompactSerializer

Another way to use Compact serialization is to implement the `CompactSerializer` interface for a class
and register it to the configuration.

For example, assume that we have the same `Employee` class as above. Then, a Compact serializer can be implemented as such.

[source,java]
----
class EmployeeSerializer implements CompactSerializer<Employee> {
    @Override
    public Employee read(CompactReader reader) {
        long id = reader.readLong("id");
        String name = reader.readString("name");
        return new Employee(id, name);
    }

    @Override
    public void write(CompactWriter writer, Employee employee) {
        writer.writeLong("id", employee.getId());
        writer.writeString("name", employee.getName());
    }
}
----

The last step is to register the serializer to the `CompactSerializationConfig`.
Below is the programmatic and declarative configurations for this step.

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
SerializationConfig serializationConfig = new SerializationConfig();
serializationConfig.
        getCompactSerializationConfig()
        .setEnabled(true) // Required during BETA
        .register(Employee.class, "employee", new EmployeeSerializer());
----

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs]
====
XML::
+
--
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <serialization>
        <compact-serialization enabled="true">
            <registered-classes>
                <class type-name="employee" serializer="com.example.EmployeeSerializer">
                    com.example.Employee
                </class>
            </registered-classes>
        </compact-serialization>
    </serialization>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

YAML::

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  serialization:
    compact-serialization:
      enabled: true
      registered-classes:
        - class: com.example.Employee
          type-name: employee
          serializer: com.example.EmployeeSerializer
----
====

A schema will be created from the serializer, and a unique schema identifier will be
assigned to it automatically.

From now on, Hazelcast will serialize instances of the `Employee` class using the `EmployeeSerializer`.

== Schema Evolution

Compact serialization permits schemas and classes to evolve by adding or removing fields, or
by changing the types of fields. More than one version of a class may live in the same cluster
and different clients or members might use different versions of the class.

Hazelcast handles the versioning internally. So, you don't have to change anything in the classes
or serializers apart from the added, removed, or changed fields.

Hazelcast achieves this by identifying each version of the class by a unique fingerprint. Any change
in a class results in a different fingerprint. Hazelcast uses 64 bits
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_fingerprint[Rabin Fingerprint] to assign identifiers to schemas, which
has an extremely low collision rate.

Different versions of the schema with different identifiers are replicated in the cluster and can be
fetched by clients or members internally. That allows old readers to read fields of the classes they
know when they try to read data serialized by a new writer. Similarly, new readers might read
fields of the classes available in the data, when they try to read data serialized by an old writer.

Assume that the two versions of the following `Employee` class lives in the cluster.

[source,java]
----
class Employee {
    long id;
    String name;
}
----

[source,java]
----
class Employee {
    private long id;
    private String name;
    private int age; // Newly added field
}
----

Then, when faced with binary data serialized by the new writer, old readers will be able to
read the following fields.

[source,java]
----
public Employee read(CompactReader reader) {
    long id = reader.readLong("id");
    String name = reader.readString("name");
    // The new "age" field is there, but the old reader does not
    // know anything about it. Hence, it will simply ignore that field.
    return new Employee(id, name);
}
----

Then, when faced with binary data serialized by the old writer, new readers will be able to
read the following fields. Also, Hazelcast provides convenient APIs to read default values
when there is no such field in the data.

[source,java]
----
public Employee read(CompactReader reader) {
    long id = reader.readLong("id");
    String name = reader.readString("name");
    // Read the "age" if it exists, or the default value 0.
    // reader.readInt("age") would throw if the "age" field
    // does not exist in data.
    int age = reader.readInt("age", 0);
    return new Employee(id, name, age);
}
----

Note that, when an old reader reads data written by an old writer, or a new reader reads a data
written by a new writer, they will be able to read all fields.

== CompactSerializationConfig

During the BETA period, Compact serialization has to be enabled explicitly as shown below.

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
SerializationConfig serializationConfig = new SerializationConfig();
serializationConfig.
        getCompactSerializationConfig()
        .setEnabled(true);
----

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs]
====
XML::
+
--
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <serialization>
        <compact-serialization enabled="true" />
    </serialization>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  serialization:
    compact-serialization:
      enabled: true
----
====

Apart from that, the configuration can be used to register either

- an explicit `CompactSerializer`
- a reflective serializer for a class.

In case of an explicit serializer, you have to supply a type name for the class.

Choosing a type name will associate that name with the schema and will make the polyglot
use cases where there are multiple clients from different languages easier.

When a class is serialized using the reflective serializer, Hazelcast will choose the
fully qualified class name as the type name automatically.

Below is the way to register an explicit serializer for a certain class.

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
SerializationConfig serializationConfig = new SerializationConfig();
serializationConfig.
        getCompactSerializationConfig()
        .setEnabled(true)
        .register(Foo.class, "foo", new FooSerializer()); // Use the "foo" as the type name
----

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs]
====
XML::
+
--
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <serialization>
        <compact-serialization enabled="true">
            <registered-classes>
                <class type-name="foo" serializer="com.example.FooSerializer">
                    com.example.Foo
                </class>
            </registered-classes>
        </compact-serialization>
    </serialization>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  serialization:
    compact-serialization:
      enabled: true
      registered-classes:
        - class: com.example.Foo
          type-name: foo
          serializer: com.example.FooSerializer
----
====

Lastly, the following is a sample configuration that registers reflective
serializer for a certain class, without implementing an explicit serializer.

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
SerializationConfig serializationConfig = new SerializationConfig();
serializationConfig.
        getCompactSerializationConfig()
        .setEnabled(true)
        .register(Bar.class); // Uses the fully qualified class name as the type name
----

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs]
====
XML::
+
--
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <serialization>
        <compact-serialization enabled="true">
            <registered-classes>
                <class>com.example.Bar</class>
            </registered-classes>
        </compact-serialization>
    </serialization>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  serialization:
    compact-serialization:
      enabled: true
      registered-classes:
        - class: com.example.Bar
----
====

If you want to override the serialization mechanism used for `Serializable` or
`Externalizable` classes and use Compact serialization; you must register
reflective serializers for them.

== GenericRecord Representation

As described in the xref:clusters:accessing-domain-objects.adoc[] section, compact serialized objects
can also be represented by a `GenericRecord`, without requiring the class in the classpath.
