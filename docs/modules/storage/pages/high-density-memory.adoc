= High-Density Memory Store

[blue]*Hazelcast Enterprise Feature*

By default, data structures in Hazelcast store data on heap in
serialized form for highest data compaction; yet, these data structures
are still subject to Java Garbage Collection (GC). Modern hardware has
much more available memory. If you want to make use of that hardware and
scale up by specifying higher heap sizes, GC becomes an increasing problem:
the application faces long GC pauses that make the application unresponsive.
Also, you may get out of memory errors if you fill your whole heap. Garbage
collection, which is the automatic process that manages the application's
runtime memory, often forces you into configurations where multiple JVMs
with small heaps (sizes of 2-4GB per member) run on a single physical hardware
device to avoid garbage collection pauses. This results in oversized clusters
to hold the data and leads to performance level requirements.

In [navy]*Hazelcast Enterprise*, the High-Density Memory Store is
Hazelcast's new enterprise in-memory storage solution. It solves garbage
collection limitations so that applications can exploit hardware memory
more efficiently without the need of oversized clusters. High-Density
Memory Store is designed as a pluggable memory manager which enables multiple
memory stores for different data structures. These memory stores are all
accessible by a common access layer that scales up to massive amounts of the main
memory on a single JVM by minimizing the GC pressure. High-Density Memory
Store enables predictable application scaling and boosts performance and
latency while minimizing garbage collection pauses.

This foundation includes, but is not limited to, storing keys and values
next to the heap in a native memory region.

High-Density Memory Store is currently provided for the following Hazelcast

== Configuring High-Density Memory Store

To use the High-Density memory storage, the native memory usage
must be enabled using the programmatic or declarative configuration.
Also, you can configure its size, memory allocator type, minimum
block size, page size and metadata space percentage.

The following are the configuration element descriptions:

* **size:** Size of the total native memory to allocate in megabytes.
Its default value is **512 MB**.
* **allocator type**: Type of the memory allocator. Available values are as follows:
** **STANDARD**: This option is used internally by Hazelcast's
POOLED allocator type or for debugging/testing purposes.
*** With this option, the memory is allocated or deallocated using
your operating system's default memory manager.
*** It uses GNU C Library's standard `malloc()` and `free()` methods
which are subject to contention on multithreaded/multicore systems.
*** Memory operations may become slower when you perform a lot of small
allocations and deallocations.
*** It may cause large memory fragmentations, unless you use a method in
the background that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance, such as `jemalloc()`.
Note that a large memory fragmentation can trigger the Linux Out of Memory
Killer if there is no swap space enabled in your system. Even if the swap
space is enabled, the killer can be again triggered if there is not enough
swap space left.
*** If you still want to use the operating system's default memory management,
you can set the allocator type to STANDARD in your native memory configuration.
** **POOLED**: This is the default option, Hazelcast's own pooling memory allocator.
*** With this option, memory blocks are managed using internal memory pools.
*** It allocates memory blocks, each of which has a 4MB page size by default,
and splits them into chunks or merges them to create larger chunks when required.
Sizing of these chunks follows the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation[buddy memory allocation^]
algorithm, i.e., power-of-two sizing.
*** It never frees memory blocks back to the operating system.
It marks disposed memory blocks as available to be used later,
meaning that these blocks are reusable.
*** Memory allocation and deallocation operations (except the ones
requiring larger sizes than the page size) do not interact with the
operating system mostly.
*** For memory allocation, it tries to find the requested memory size inside
the internal memory pools. If it cannot be found, then it interacts with the operating system.
* **minimum block size:** Minimum size of the blocks in bytes to split and
fragment a page block to assign to an allocation request. It is used only
by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Its default value is **16 bytes**.
* **page size:** Size of the page in bytes to allocate memory as a block.
It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Its default value is `1 << 22` = **4194304 Bytes**, about **4 MB**.
* **metadata space percentage:** Defines the percentage of the allocated
native memory that is used for internal memory structures by the High-Density
Memory for tracking the used and available memory blocks. It is used only by
the **POOLED** memory allocator. Its default value is **12.5**. Please note that
when the memory runs out, you get a `NativeOutOfMemoryException`;  if your store
has a large number of entries, you should consider increasing this percentage.
* **persistent-memory:** See the <<using-persistent-memory, Using Persistent Memory section>> below.

== Using Persistent Memory

NOTE: The High-Density Memory Store uses persistent memory in volatile mode,
which means all data is lost after the instance restarts. For durability, please check
the xref:persistence.adoc[Persistence] feature.

To support larger and more affordable storage for data structures like IMap,
ICache and Near Cache, Hazelcast provides integration with persistent memory
technologies like Intel(R) Optane(TM) DC. To benefit from the technology, you
do not need to make any changes in your application code.
Only a few configuration changes are required.

NOTE: Note that integration with Intel(R) Optane(TM) DC is supported on Linux
operating system and it is for Optane DIMMs (not SSDs).

The optional `persistent-memory` element in the `native-memory` configuration block
enables the persistent memory usage and defines the directories where this memory
is mounted along with its operational mode. See the element descriptions below the
following configuration snippets.

config.setNativeMemoryConfig(memoryConfig);

The above snippets demonstrate how to configure the persistent memory as
High-Density Memory Store in Hazelcast. The example assumes dual-socket machine;
both sockets are populated with Intel(R) Optane(TM) DC persistent memory DIMMs that
are configured in interleaved mode. The two sockets' DIMMs are mounted as `/mnt/pmem0`
and `/mnt/pmem1` and are known as NUMA node0 and node1, respectively.

Here are the descriptions of the  persistent memory configuration elements and attributes:

* `enabled`: Specifies whether the persistent memory usage is enabled or not. Its default value is `false`, 
i.e., persistent memory usage is disabled.
* `mode`: Defines the persistent memory operational mode. Two modes are supported:
** `MOUNTED`: If you choose this mode, the persistent memory is mounted into the file system (aka FS DAX).
** `SYSTEM_MEMORY`: If you choose this mode, the persistent memory is onlined as system memory (aka KMEM DAX).
* `directories`: List of the persistent memory mounting directories to store data of all the data structures backed by
High-Density Memory Store. When you provide the directories:
** the persistent memory usage is enabled automatically and you do not need to explicitly
set the `enabled` attribute to `true`
** the `mode` should be set to `MOUNTED`.
+
If you do not provide a persistent memory directory is configured, standard RAM is used.

=== Allocation Strategies

Since on multi-socket machines there could be multiple persistent memory
mount points, the memory allocations need to follow an allocation strategy.
Starting with 4.1, Hazelcast supports two allocation strategies:

* Round-robin allocation strategy
* NUMA-aware allocation strategy

Hazelcast's memory allocator chooses and statically caches one of them for
every allocator thread for the entire lifetime of the Hazelcast instance.

==== Round-robin Allocation Strategy

Hazelcast iterates over the configured persistent memory directories and
makes sure every allocation is done in a different directory than the last.
This is a best-effort attempt to distribute the allocations evenly on the
persistent memory DIMMs, which is important from the utilization and
performance points of view as well. This is the default allocation strategy.

==== NUMA-aware Allocation Strategy

The persistent memory modules are mounted in the memory slots just like the
regular memory modules and sharing the same memory bus. Therefore, the same
NUMA locality concerns apply to the persistent memory that apply to regular
memory. This means accessing the persistent memory modules attached to the
socket on which the current thread runs is cheaper than accessing the
persistent memory modules attached to a different socket. These are typically
referenced as NUMA-local and NUMA-remote memories. To achieve the best
possible performance, Hazelcast implements a NUMA-aware  allocation strategy
to ensure all persistent memory accesses are local, if certain conditions hold.

To enable this allocation strategy for a certain thread, the thread has to be
bounded to a single NUMA node, which means the kernel's scheduler makes sure
the thread can be scheduled only on the CPUs of a single NUMA node. Starting
with Hazelcast 4.1 this can be done with thread group granularity. For the
detailed explanation please refer to the xref:performance:cpu-thread-affinity.adoc[thread affinity documentation]. What
makes the biggest impact on performance is enabling the NUMA-aware allocation
strategy for the operation threads. An example configuration for that is as follows:

```
-Dhazelcast.operation.thread.affinity=[0-9,20-29]:20,[10-19,30-39]:20
```

The above example configuration restricts all 40 operation threads to run on a single NUMA node
on a dual-socket 40 core system, where node0's CPU set is `[0-9,20-29]` and
node1's CPU set is `[10-19,30-39]`. The NUMA nodes and their CPU sets can be
discovered by the `numactl -H` command.

The second requirement for the NUMA-aware strategy is defining the NUMA node
for every persistent memory directory in the configuration. If both configurations
are done properly, the threads in the thread groups restricted to run on a single
NUMA node will use the NUMA-aware allocation strategy, while the rest of threads
will still use the round-robin strategy. To check which persistent memory is
attached to which NUMA node, the command `ndctl list -v -m fsdax` can be used.
Please check which mount point represents which persistent memory device in the
output of `ndctl`.

=== Allocation Overflowing

Since both allocation strategies try to allocate from a single persistent
memory directory, it may happen that the chosen directory cannot serve the
allocation request due to lack of free capacity. In this case, both strategies
take the other directories and try to serve the allocation from those. Please
note that this compromises the NUMA-aware strategy in the way that there will
be NUMA-remote persistent memory accesses.

=== On the Performance of Persistent Memory

While the persistent memory modules are mounted next to the regular memory
modules and sharing the same memory bus, the two types of the modules have
different performance characteristics. First, the persistent memory modules
can be accessed with higher latency than the regular memory modules. Second,
while with the regular memory modules the performance of the reads and the
writes are not different, this is not the case with the persistent memory
modules. The persistent memory has an asymmetric performance profile, which
means the writes are slower than the reads.

Despite the above facts, whether the higher latency of the persistent memory
impacts the performance of Hazelcast depends on multiple factors. Since
Hazelcast is a distributed platform, the higher latency of the persistent memory
modules can easily be hidden by the latency variance of the network and in the
end, in certain use cases there may be no observable difference in the throughput
of Hazelcast if it stores its data on persistent memory or on regular memory.
Such a use case is caching, where accessing the entries remotely through
Hazelcast clients results in a very similar throughput. Based on our tests with
Intel(R) Optane(TM) DC persistent memory modules we recommend the Optane modules
for the caching use case up to 10KB entry size.

Other use cases that don't involve networking, such as iterating over all entries
with entry processors can be impacted by the higher latency of the persistent
memory modules, especially, if the entry processors update a significant portion
of the entries. In general, in such a use case the higher the entry size, the
higher the impact on the performance. That means with smaller entry sizes the
performance of Hazelcast with persistent memory can be comparable to the
performance with regular memory.
