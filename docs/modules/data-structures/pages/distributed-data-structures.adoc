= Distributed Data Structures

Hazelcast offers
distributed implementations of many common data structures. For each of the client
languages, Hazelcast mimics as closely as possible the natural interface of the
structure. For example in Java, the map follows `java.util.Map` semantics.
All of these structures are available in Java, .NET, C++, Node.js, Python, and Go.

[[partitioned]]
== Partitioned vs Non-Partitioned

Hazelcast data structures use one of the following partitioning strategies:

- *Partitioned:* Each partition stores a part of the whole data structure.
- *Non-partitioned:* A single partition stores the whole data structure.

For details about how Hazelcast partitions data, see xref:consistency-and-replication:replication-algorithm.adoc[]

[[controlling-partitions]]
=== Controlling Partitions

Hazelcast uses the name of a distributed object to determine in which partition it will be put.

In this example, the queues have different names, so they will be placed into different partitions:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
IQueue q1 = hazelcastInstance.getQueue("q1");
IQueue q2 = hazelcastInstance.getQueue("q2");
----

If you want to put these two into the same partition, you use the `@` symbol:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
IQueue q1 = hazelcastInstance.getQueue("q1@foo");
IQueue q2 = hazelcastInstance.getQueue("q2@foo");
----

Now, these two queues will be put into the same partition whose partition key is `foo`.
Note that you can use the `getPartitionKey()` method to learn the partition key of a distributed object.
It may be useful when you want to create an object in the same partition as an existing object:

[source,java]
----
String partitionKey = q1.getPartitionKey();
IQueue q3 = hazelcastInstance.getQueue("q3@"+partitionKey);
----

[[loading-and-destroying-a-distributed-object]]
== Loading Objects

Hazelcast offers a `get()` method for most of its distributed objects. To load an object,
first create a Hazelcast instance and then use the related `get()` method on this instance.
The following code snippet creates a Hazelcast member and a map:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map<Integer, String> customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "customers" );
----

== Destroying Objects

To destroy a Hazelcast distributed object, you can use the `destroy()` method, which clears
and releases all resources of the object. Therefore, you must use it with care since a reload
with the same object reference after the object is destroyed creates a new data structure without
an error. See the following example code where one of the queues are destroyed and the other
one is accessed.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/MapMember.java[tag=mapmember]
----

If you start the member, you see the following output:

[source,shell]
----
q1.size: 1 q2.size:1
q1.size: 0 q2.size:0
----

As you see, no error is generated and a new queue resource is created.

Hazelcast is designed to create any distributed data structure whenever it is accessed.

Therefore, keep in mind that a
data structure is recreated when you perform an operation on it even after you have destroyed it.

== Configuring Data Structures

As to the configuration of distributed objects, Hazelcast uses the default settings
from the `hazelcast.xml` file that comes with your Hazelcast member download. Of course,
you can provide an explicit configuration in this file or programmatically according
to your needs. See the xref:configuration:understanding-configuration.adoc[Understanding Configuration section].

Note that, most of Hazelcast's distributed objects are created lazily: A distributed object
is created once the first operation accesses it.

If you want to use an object you loaded in other places, you can safely reload it using its
reference without creating a new Hazelcast instance.

[[ap-data]]
== AP Data Structures

AP data structures prefer availability over consistency. 

When a partition occurs, all members remain available but some might return an older version of data than others. When the partition is resolved, the members usually resynchronize to repair any inconsistencies:

[[common-features-of-all-hazelcast-data-structures]]

* If a member goes down, its backup replica (which holds the same data) dynamically
redistributes the data, including the ownership and locks on them, to the remaining
live members. As a result, there will not be any data loss.
* There is no single cluster master that can be a single point of failure.
Every member in the cluster has equal rights and responsibilities. No single member is
superior.

[[example-distributed-object-code]]
=== Example Code

Here is an example of how you can retrieve existing AP data structure instances and how you can listen for instance events,
such as an instance being created or destroyed.

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/ExampleDOL.java[tag=sampledol]
----

NOTE: The `getDistributedObjects()` method returns internal API objects
with prefixes, including `\__sql` and `__jet`, such as `__sql.catalog`. You can ignore these objects.

[[cp-data]]
== CP Data Structures

A CP data structure delivers consistency and partition tolerance at the expense of availability. When a partition occurs between any two CP members, the non-consistent CP member must be shut down until the partition is resolved.

To learn about CP members and how Hazelcast delivers consistency and partition tolerance, see xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP Subsystem].

The CP data structures differ from AP data structures in two aspects:

* An internal commit is performed on the `METADATA` CP group every time you
fetch a CP data structure object. Hence, the callers should cache the returned
objects.
* If you call the `destroy()` method on a CP data structure object, that data structure is terminated in the underlying CP group and cannot be reinitialized until the CP group is force-destroyed. For this reason,
please make sure that you are completely done with a CP data structure before destroying it.

=== Creating CP Groups

To create a custom CP group, add an `@` symbol to the end of the data structures name, followed by the name of the group that you want to create and store the data structure in. For example, here, a new CP group is created with the name `myGroup` and then an atomic long called `myAtomicLong` is initialized in this custom CP group: `.getAtomicLong("myAtomicLong@myGroup")`.

If you use fenced locks or semaphores, we recommend using a minimal number of CP groups. For these data structures, a Hazelcast member or client starts
a new xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc#sessions[session] on the corresponding CP group when it makes its very first acquisition request, and then periodically commits session heartbeats
to this CP group in order to indicate its liveliness. If fenced
locks and semaphores are distributed to multiple CP groups, there will be
a session management overhead on each CP group. Therefore, for most use
cases, the `DEFAULT` CP group should be sufficient to maintain all CP data
structure instances. Custom CP groups is recommended only when you benchmark
your deployment and decide that performance of the `DEFAULT` CP group is not
sufficient for your workload.
