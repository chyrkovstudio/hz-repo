[[cpmap]]

Hazelcast `CPMap` is a distributed implementation of a minimal key-value interface. It supports 
atomic `compareAndSet`, `delete`, `get`, `put`, `remove` and `set` operations. As `CPMap` is a 
distributed key-value implementation, these operations involve remote calls and their 
performance differs from non-distributed key-value data structures; for example, `java.util.HashMap`. 
`CPMap` is only available in the Enterprise Edition.

There is no unsafe variant of `CPMap`, unlike other CP data structures. Therefore, CP must be 
xref:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc#quickstart-configuration[enabled,window=_blank] before using `CPMap`.

The following example creates an instance of a `CPMap` in the `default` CP group, then updates its
contents using the operations listed previously.

The mutations over the `CPMap` `capitalCities` in the above example are replicated across each of 
the members of the `default` CP Group. 

Use `set` to associate a key with a value instead of `put` when the 
previously-associated value with the respective key is not required. This is because the network
cost of `set` is less than `put`. Use `delete` instead of `remove` for the same reason.

WARNING: ``CPMap``s are not automatically removed. If an instance is not used anymore, Hazelcast
does not automatically perform garbage collection on it.
This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`. If you create ``CPMap``s on the fly,
ensure that they are destroyed. See xref:data-structures:distributed-data-structures.adoc#destroying-objects[Destroying Objects,window=_blank]
and xref:data-structures:distributed-data-structures.adoc#cp-data[CP Data Structures,window=_blank].

A `CPMap` has a default capacity of 100MB. This capacity can be adjusted for a `CPMap` through 
xref:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc#cpmap-config[CPMap Options,window=_blank]. The backing data 
structure of a `CPMap` is stored on the JVM heap.

[NOTE]
====
A `CPMap` is a CP data structure and therefore takes part in a process called _snapshotting_.
When defining the capacity of a `CPMap` you must consider the following memory requirements: 

* On-heap capacity for the `CPMap`
* On-heap capacity for a `CPMap` snapshot for each follower within the respective CP Group 

Therefore, at a minimum for a `CPMap` with a capacity of `5MB` within a 3-member CP Group, we must 
conservatively ensure that we have on-heap headroom for `15MB`. This capacity planning must be 
considered for all `CPMap` instances you intend to create.
====

A `CPMap` like other CP data structures resides within a user specified CP Group. Each CP 
Group is an instance of Raft and consequently has its own Raft Log. Co-locating CP data structures 
within the same CP Group must be undertaken with care as the operations of the co-located CP data 
structures are totally ordered with respect to one another via Raft. Snapshotting also takes place 
at the granularity of a CP Group. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you carefully consider 
the envisaged access frequency and patterns of a `CPMap` when deciding the CP Group a `CPMap` will 
reside.
