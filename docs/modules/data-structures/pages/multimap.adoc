[[multimap]]

Hazelcast MultiMap is a specialized map where you can store multiple values
under a single key. Just like any other distributed data structure implementation in
Hazelcast, MultiMap is distributed and thread-safe.

MultiMap supports most features of Hazelcast Map except for indexing,
predicates and MapLoader/MapStore. The entries are almost evenly
distributed onto all cluster members. However, this distribution is based on the entry keys:
if there are multiple entries having the same key but different values,
such entries are stored on the same member, otherwise they are distributed among the members.
When a new member joins the cluster, the same
ownership logic used in the Hazelcast Map applies.
