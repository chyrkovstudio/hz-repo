= Recovery from a Partial or Total Failure

Under normal circumstances, Hazelcast members are self-recoverable as in the following scenarios:

• Automatic split-brain resolution
• Hazelcast allowing stuck/unreachable members to come back within configured tolerance levels;
see the xref:fault-tolerance:backups.adoc[Configuring for Fault Tolerance section].

However, in the rare case when a member is declared unreachable by Hazelcast
because it fails to respond, but the rest of the cluster is still running, consider the followings for recovery:

* Collect Hazelcast xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#logging[logs] from all members, active and unresponsive.
* Collect Hazelcast client xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#logging[logs] or application logs from all clients.
* If the cluster is running and one or more members were ejected from the cluster because it was stuck,
take a <<heap-dumps, heap dump>> and <<thread-dumps, thread-dump>> of any stuck members.
* After collecting all the necessary artifacts, shut down the ailing members by calling shutdown hooks;
see the xref:maintain-cluster:shutdown.adoc[Shutting Down the Cluster section].
* After shutdown, start the ailing members and wait for them to join the cluster. After successfully joining,
Hazelcast rebalances the data across the members.
