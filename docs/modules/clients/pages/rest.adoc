= REST Client
[[rest-client]]

Hazelcast provides a REST interface: it provides an HTTP service
in each cluster member so that you can access your data
structures and cluster using the HTTP protocol.

IMPORTANT: REST service is disabled in the configuration by default.
You should enable it on your cluster members to use the REST client
as follows:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <rest-api enabled="true">
        ...
        </rest-api>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    rest-api:
      enabled: true
----
====

Hazelcast uses grouped endpoints to provide the communication
via REST interface. In this section, as an example, we show various operations
that are performed on the **data structures** in a cluster using the REST calls.
For these operations to work, in addition to enabling the REST service as shown above,
you also need to enable the `DATA` endpoint group which allows accessing the data structures,
as shown below:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <rest-api enabled="true">
            <endpoint-group name="DATA" enabled="true"/>
        </rest-api>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        DATA:
          enabled: true
----
====

See the <<using-the-rest-endpoint-groups, Using the REST Endpoint Groups section>> for details
and to learn about the other endpoint groups Hazelcast offers.

In terms of data structures, currently maps and queues are supported.
Assuming `mapName` and `queueName` are already configured in your Hazelcast,
the structure of REST calls is shown below:

`+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key+`

`+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/queueName+`

For the operations to be performed, standard REST conventions for HTTP calls are used.

All parameters that are used in REST API URLs, such as
the distributed data structure and key names, must be
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[URL encoded^]
when composing a call. As an example, `name.with/special@chars`
parameter value would be encoded as `name.with%2Fspecial%40chars`.

== REST Client GET/POST/DELETE Examples

All of the requests below can return one of the following responses in case of a failure.

* If the HTTP request syntax is not known, the following response is returned.
+
```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Length: 0
```
+
* In case of an unexpected exception, the following response is returned.
+
```
< HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
< Content-Length: 0
```

=== Creating/Updating Entries in a Map for REST Client

You can put a new `key1/value1` entry into a map by using `POST` call to
`+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key1+` URL.
This call's content body should contain the value of the key.
Also, if the call contains the MIME type, Hazelcast stores this information, too.

An example `POST` call is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "bar"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
----

It returns the following response if successful:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
----

If your `POST` call has a trailing slash, Hazelcast will strip it so that it is not appended to the key string. So if you send this `POST` call:

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "bar"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo/
----

The `POST` call will instead be processed as below:

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "bar"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
----

=== Retrieving Entries from a Map for REST Client

If you want to retrieve an entry, you can use a `GET` call
to `+http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key1+`.
You can also retrieve this entry from another member of your cluster, such as
`+http://<another member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key1+`.

An example of a `GET` call is shown below.

```
curl -X GET http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
```

It returns the following response if there is a corresponding value:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 3
bar
```

This `GET` call returned a value, its length and also the MIME type
(`text/plain`) since the POST call example shown above included the MIME type.

It returns the following if there is no mapping for the given key:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
< Content-Length: 0
----

Similarly to the `POST` call, Hazelcast will strip the trailing slash from your `GET` call.

=== Removing Entries from a Map for REST Client

You can use a `DELETE` call to remove an entry. An example `DELETE` call is shown below with its response.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X DELETE http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo
----

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
```

If you leave the key empty as follows, the `DELETE` call deletes all entries from the map.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X DELETE http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName
----

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
----

=== Offering Items on a Queue for REST Client

You can use a `POST` call to create an item on the queue. An example is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "foo"
    http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents
----

The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance.getQueue("myEvents").offer("foo");`.

It returns the following if successful:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
----

It returns the following if the queue is full and the item is not able to be offered to the queue:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
< Content-Length: 0
----

=== Retrieving Items from a Queue for REST Client

You can use a `DELETE` call for retrieving items from a queue.
Note that you should state the poll timeout while polling for queue events by an extra path parameter.

An example is shown below (**10** being the timeout value).

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X DELETE \http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents/10
----

The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance.getQueue("myEvents").poll(10, SECONDS);`.
Below is the response.

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 3
foo
----

When the timeout is reached, the response is `No Content` success, i.e.,
there is no item on the queue to be returned.

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
< Content-Length: 0
----

=== Getting the size of the queue for REST Client

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X GET \http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents/size
----

The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance.getQueue("myEvents").size();`.
Below is an example response.

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 1
5
----

== Checking the Status of the Cluster for REST Client

Besides the above operations, you can check the status of your cluster,
an example of which is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/cluster
----

The response is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "members": [
    {
      "address": "<member IP address>:<port>",
      "liteMember": false,
      "localMember": true,
      "uuid": "73f5d6ad-7b51-4e74-bd74-15b2e7de7edd",
      "memberVersion": "4.0.0"
    },
    {
      "address": "<another member IP address>:<port>",
      "liteMember": false,
      "localMember": false,
      "uuid": "e8b41ac6-9db9-43f1-9e98-8b0392891560",
      "memberVersion": "4.0.0"
    },
    {
      "address": "<another member IP address>:<port>",
      "liteMember": false,
      "localMember": false,
      "uuid": "c6929312-d4d3-4527-83bc-474c229394d6",
      "memberVersion": "4.0.0"
    }
  ],
  "connectionCount": 1,
  "allConnectionCount": 3
}
----

== Checking the Name of the Instance for REST Client

Additionally, you can check the name of any instance of your cluster.
An example is shown below.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v http://<member IP address>:<port>/hazelcast/rest/instance
----

The response is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 27

{"name":"adoring_brattain"}
----

---

RESTful access is provided through any member of your cluster.
You can even put an HTTP load-balancer in front of your cluster members for load balancing and fault tolerance.

NOTE: You need to handle the failures on REST polls as there is no transactional guarantee.

== Using the REST Endpoint Groups

Hazelcast members exposes various REST endpoints and these are grouped.
REST endpoint groups are as follows:

* `CLUSTER_READ`
* `CLUSTER_WRITE`
* `HEALTH_CHECK`
* `HOT_RESTART`
* `WAN`
* `DATA`
* `CP`


IMPORTANT: Using the REST service is disabled by default.
To be able to use the REST endpoints, you need to
enable the REST API as follows:

[tabs]

|===


You can enable or disable any REST endpoint group using
the following declarative configuration (`HEALTH_CHECK` group is used as an example):

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <rest-api enabled="true">
            <endpoint-group name="HEALTH_CHECK" enabled="false"/>
        </rest-api>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    rest-api:
      enabled: true
      endpoint-groups:
        HEALTH_CHECK
          enabled: false
----
====

The following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
RestApiConfig restApiConfig = new RestApiConfig()
        .setEnabled(true)
        .disableGroups(RestEndpointGroup.HEALTH_CHECK);
Config config = new Config();
config.getNetworkConfig().setRestApiConfig(restApiConfig);
----

Alternatively, you can also use the `advanced-network` element for the same purpose:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <advanced-network enabled="true">
        <rest-server-socket-endpoint-config>
            <endpoint-groups>
                <endpoint-group name="HEALTH_CHECK" enabled="false"/>
            </endpoint-groups>
        </rest-server-socket-endpoint-config>
    </advanced-network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  advanced-network:
    enabled: true
    rest-server-socket-endpoint-config:
      endpoint-groups:
        HEALTH_CHECK:
          enabled: false
----
====

And the following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
RestServerEndpointConfig restServerEndpointConfig = new RestServerEndpointConfig().disableGroups(RestEndpointGroup.HEALTH_CHECK);
Config config = new Config();
config.getAdvancedNetworkConfig()
      .setEnabled(true)
      .setRestEndpointConfig(restServerEndpointConfig);
----

NOTE: See the xref:clusters:network-configuration.adoc[Advanced Network Configuration section]
for more information on the `advanced-network` element.

When you enable or disable a REST endpoint group, all the endpoints in that group
are enabled or disabled, respectively. For the examples above, we disabled the endpoints
belonging to the `HEALTH_CHECK` endpoint group.
