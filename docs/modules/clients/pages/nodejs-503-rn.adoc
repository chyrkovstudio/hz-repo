= 5.0.3 Release Notes
:description: These release notes list any new features, enhancements, and fixes that were made between version 5.0.2 and 5.0.3 of Hazelcast Node.js client.

{description} 

== New Features

* Introduced the `security` configuration element to enable username/password, token, or custom
authentications. Previously, the `customCredentials` object was being used for security, but username/password
or token based authentication could not be defined.

== Enhancements

* Improved the security config validation: initializing username/password with `null` to avoid them being `undefined`
and throwing exception if token is not provided in token credentials.
