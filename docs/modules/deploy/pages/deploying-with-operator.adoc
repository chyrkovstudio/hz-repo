= Deploy a Cluster with the Enterprise Operator (Preview)
[[deploying-with-operator]]

NOTE: Hazelcast Enterprise Operator is currently in the early alpha preview stage, but it will soon become the preferred way of installing Hazelcast in Kubernetes/OpenShift environments.

The simplest way of installing and operating your Hazelcast Enterprise cluster in the Kubernetes (and OpenShift) environments is to use Hazelcast Enterprise Operator.

== Deploy Hazelcast Enterprise Operator

You can deploy Hazelcast Enterprise Operator by creating the following `bundle.yaml` file.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/operator/bundle.yaml[]
----

Then, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster with the following command.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f bundle.yaml
----

At this point, your Hazelcast Enteprise Operator should be up and running. You can check it with the following command.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs deployment.apps/hazelcast-enterprise-controller-manager
----

```
2021-07-14T09:03:40.713Z        INFO    setup   Watching namespace: default
2021-07-14T09:03:41.524Z        INFO    controller-runtime.metrics      metrics server is starting to listen    {"addr": ":8080"}
2021-07-14T09:03:41.524Z        INFO    setup   starting manager
2021-07-14T09:03:41.525Z        INFO    controller-runtime.manager      starting metrics server {"path": "/metrics"}
```

== Customize Namespace (optional)

By default, Hazelcast Operator is installed into the `default` namespace. If you want to change it, you can either replace all `namespace: default` parameters in `bundle.yaml` or use https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize] to achieve it by creating the following `kustomization.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
namespace: <your-namespace>
resources:
- bundle.yaml
----

Then, use Kustomize to apply `bundle.yaml` with the changed namespace.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -k .
----

Note that you'll need to add a parameter `-n <your-namespace>` to all further commands.

== Create Secret with Hazelcast License Key

Hazelcast Enteprise requires having the license key specified as Kubernetes Secret.

NOTE: If you don't have Hazelcast Enterprise License Key, please check xref:deploy:using-enterprise-edition.adoc#requesting-a-license-key[Requesting a License Key]

[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<YOUR LICENSE KEY>
----

== Start Hazelcast Enterprise Cluster

Finally, you can create `Hazelcast` Custom Resource file as `hazelcast.yaml`.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/operator/hazelcast.yaml[]
----

Apply it with the following command to start the Hazelcast cluster.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f hazelcast.yaml
----

After a moment, you can verify that Hazelcast cluster is up and running by checking the Hazelcast member logs.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs pod/hazelcast-sample-0
----

```
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.36.8.3]:5701 - ccf31703-de3b-4094-9faf-7b5d0dc145b2 this
        Member [10.36.7.2]:5701 - e75bd6e2-de4b-4360-8113-040773d858b7
        Member [10.36.6.2]:5701 - c3d105d2-0bca-4a66-8519-1cacffc05c98
]
```

== Connect to Hazelcast from Outside Kubernetes

To connect to a Hazelcast cluster from outside Kubernetes, you need to configure the `expose-externally` field of your custom resource.


[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/operator/hazelcast_expose_externally.yaml[]
----

After applying the configuration change in Kubernetes, each Hazelcast member will be exposed as a separate service.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get service
----

```
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
hazelcast-sample     LoadBalancer   10.219.246.19    35.230.92.217   5701:30560/TCP   2m11s
hazelcast-sample-0   NodePort       10.219.254.192   <none>          5701:31890/TCP   2m11s
hazelcast-sample-1   NodePort       10.219.247.43    <none>          5701:32310/TCP   2m11s
hazelcast-sample-2   NodePort       10.219.243.16    <none>          5701:32585/TCP   2m11s
```

To connect to the cluster, you can add the external IP address of the LoadBalancer service to your Hazelcast client configuration.

You can configure the `expose-externally` field with the following properties:

* `type`: The way in which Hazelcast members are exposed to clients.
** `Unisocket`: Members are exposed via one Kubernetes service.
** `Smart`: Each member is exposed via a separate Kubernetes service.
* `discoveryServiceType`: Type of Kubernetes service used for discovering members in a Hazelcast cluster.
** `LoadBalancer` (default): Hazelcast client configuration `<load-balancer-external-ip>:5701`.
** `NodePort`: Hazelcast client configuration `<node-address>:<node-port>`.
* `memberAccess`: The way in which clients access Hazelcast members.
** `NodePortExternalIP` (default): Hazelcast clients are outside the Kubernetes network, so a client can access members only via the public IP address that's assigned to their Kubernetes nodes.
** `NodePortNodeName`: Hazelcast clients are inside the same network as the Kubernetes nodes, so clients can access a member by the hostname of its Kubernetes node.
** `LoadBalancer`: Hazelcast clients are outside the Kubernetes network and can access members via the the external IP assigned to the LoadBalancer service.

WARNING: Your Kubernetes cluster should be able to assign public IPs to LoadBalancer services to connect to Hazelcast from outside Kubernetes.

WARNING: If NodePorts are used (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), then the Kubernetes nodes should have access from outside Kubernetes. This includes both the node IPs and ports.

=== Google Kubernetes Engine

If you are using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and trying to connect to Hazelcast from outside Kubernetes, then you need to consider the following:

- The Kubernetes cluster should not be private.
- If NodePorts are used (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), a firewall rule for each Hazelcast member should be added to allow TCP traffic on node ports.

=== Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

If you are using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and trying to connect to Hazelcast from outside Kubernetes, then you need to consider the following:

- Having the VPC of the EKS cluster configured only with private subnets is not recommended.
- If NodePorts are used (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), the VPC of the EKS cluster should be configured only with public subnets. Additionally, inbound rules for the node ports should be added to the nodes' security groups.
- AWS load balancers are assigned with hostnames by default. Since it takes some time to resolve these hostnames, the member pods might fail to start with `CrashLoopBackOff` status in the beginning. But the pods will be running fine eventually after a couple of restarts.

=== Azure Kubernetes Service

If you are using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and trying to connect to Hazelcast from outside Kubernetes, then you need to consider the following:

- The Kubernetes cluster should not be private.
- If NodePorts are used (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), the node pools should be created by using `--enable-node-public-ip` flag. Additionally, the required inbound rules should be added for network security groups (NSGs) to allow access to node IPs and ports.

== Check that the Hazelcast Cluster is Running

To check if a cluster is running, see the `status` field of the Hazelcast resource.
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
status:
  hazelcastClusterStatus:
    readyMembers: 3/3
  phase: Running
----

The `phase` field represents the current status of the cluster, and can contain any of the following values:

* `Running`: The cluster is up and running.
* `Pending`: The cluster is in the process of starting.
* `Failed`: An error occurred while starting the cluster.

The `readyMembers` field represents the number of Hazelcast members that are connected to the cluster.

WARNING: Use the `readyMembers` field only for informational purposes. This field is not always accurate. Some members may have joined or left the cluster since this field was last updated.

== Start Management Center

You can monitor the Hazelcast cluster by starting the Management Center. You can create `ManagementCenter` custom resource file as `management-center.yaml`.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/operator/management-center.yaml[]
----
WARNING: StatefulSet does not support updates to `volumeClaimTemplates` field, so `persistence` field should be set only at the creation of the custom resource. Any update to the `persistence` field will not affect the Management Center.

WARNING: `hazelcastClusters` field does not support deleting clusters from the custom resource. If you want to remove a cluster from the Management Center, you can do it from the Management Center UI.

Apply it with the following command to start Management Center.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f management-center.yaml
----

After a moment, you can verify that Management Center is up and running by checking the Management Center logs.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs managementcenter-sample-0
----
