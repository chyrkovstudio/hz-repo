= Deploy a Cluster with the Enterprise Operator (Preview)
[[deploying-with-operator]]

NOTE: Hazelcast Enterprise Operator is currently in the early alpha preview stage, but it will soon become the preferred way of installing Hazelcast in Kubernetes/OpenShift environments.

The simplest way of installing and operating your Hazelcast Enterprise cluster in the Kubernetes (and OpenShift) environments is to use Hazelcast Enterprise Operator.

== Deploy Hazelcast Enterprise Operator

You can deploy Hazelcast Enterprise Operator by creating the following `bundle.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
include::ROOT:example$/operator/bundle.yaml[]
----

Then, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster with the following command.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f bundle.yaml
----

At this point, your Hazelcast Enteprise Operator should be up and running. You can check it with the following command.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs deployment.apps/hazelcast-enterprise-controller-manager

2021-07-14T09:03:40.713Z        INFO    setup   Watching namespace: default
2021-07-14T09:03:41.524Z        INFO    controller-runtime.metrics      metrics server is starting to listen    {"addr": ":8080"}
2021-07-14T09:03:41.524Z        INFO    setup   starting manager
2021-07-14T09:03:41.525Z        INFO    controller-runtime.manager      starting metrics server {"path": "/metrics"}
...
----

== Customize Namespace (optional)

By default, Hazelcast Operator is installed into the `default` namespace. If you want to change it, you can either replace all `namespace: default` parameters in `bundle.yaml` or use https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize] to achieve it by creating the following `kustomization.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
namespace: <your-namespace>
resources:
- bundle.yaml
----

Then, use Kustomize to apply `bundle.yaml` with the changed namespace.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -k .
----

Note that you'll need to add a parameter `-n <your-namespace>` to all further commands.

== Create Secret with Hazelcast License Key

Hazelcast Enteprise requires having the license key specified as Kubernetes Secret.

NOTE: If you don't have Hazelcast Enterprise License Key, please check xref:deploy:using-enterprise-edition.adoc#requesting-a-license-key[Requesting a License Key]

[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<YOUR LICENSE KEY>
----

== Start Hazelcast Enterprise Cluster

Finally, you can create `Hazelcast` Custom Resource file as `hazelcast.yaml`.

[source,yaml]
----
include::ROOT:example$/operator/hazelcast.yaml[]
----

Apply it with the following command to start the Hazelcast cluster.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f hazelcast.yaml
----

After a moment, you can verify that Hazelcast cluster is up and running by checking the Hazelcast member logs.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs pod/hazelcast-sample-0
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.36.8.3]:5701 - ccf31703-de3b-4094-9faf-7b5d0dc145b2 this
        Member [10.36.7.2]:5701 - e75bd6e2-de4b-4360-8113-040773d858b7
        Member [10.36.6.2]:5701 - c3d105d2-0bca-4a66-8519-1cacffc05c98
]
...
----

== Clean up

Run the following commands to remove Hazelcast cluster, Hazelcast License Key Secret, and Hazelcast Enterprise Operator.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete -f hazelcast.yaml
kubectl delete secret hazelcast-license-key
kubectl delete -f bundle.yaml
----
