= Renewing a License Key

License keys are often valid only for a certain period of time.

To upgrade or renew a license key, you can do one of the following:

- Email mailto:sales@hazelcast.com[Sales].

- Email mailto:support@hazelcast.com[Support].

- Call your sales representative.

To install a new license key, replace the license key on each member host and restart each one at a time. If you want to add a new license key to a running cluster, you can use the xref:updating-license-rest.adoc[REST API].

NOTE: If your license is expired on a running cluster or Management Center,
do not restart the host device.
Reach out to Hazelcast Support to resolve any issues with an expired license.
