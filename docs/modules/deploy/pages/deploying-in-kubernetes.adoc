== Limitations

Hazelcast CP Subsystem can be used safely in Kubernetes only if xref:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc#cp-subsystem-configuration[CP Subsystem Persistence] is enabled (Enterprise Feature). Otherwise, a CP Subsystem Group may not recover after scaling the cluster or a rolling upgrade.

== Quickstart

If you just want to play with Hazelcast on Kubernetes, execute the following commands to create a Hazelcast cluster
with 3 members in the `default` namespace using the `default` Service Account.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/master/kubernetes-rbac.yaml
kubectl run hazelcast-1 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version}
kubectl run hazelcast-2 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version}
kubectl run hazelcast-3 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version}
----

Hazelcast members <<discovering-members-in-kubernetes-automatically, automatically discover themselves>> and form one Hazelcast cluster.

NOTE: For production-grade Kubernetes deployment, use Helm chart or Hazelcast Platform Operator.

== Helm Chart

https://helm.sh/[Helm^] is a package manager for Kubernetes. Hazelcast is distributed in a form of Helm Charts:

* https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast[hazelcast/hazelcast^]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-enterprise[hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise^]

See the https://github.com/hazelcast/charts[Hazelcast Helm Charts documentation^]
for more details.

== Hazelcast Platform Operator

Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes which help you create and manage your applications. Hazelcast Platform Operator automates common management tasks such as configuring, creating, and scaling Hazelcast clusters on Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. By taking care of manual deployment and life-cycle management, Hazelcast Platform Operator makes it simpler to work with Hazelcast clusters.

See the https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest/[Hazelcast Platform Operator Documentation] for more information and find details about deploying a Hazelcast cluster in Kubernetes and also connecting clients outside Kubernetes.

== Helm-based Kubernetes/OpenShift Operators

You can deploy and manage Hazelcast using the following Helm-based Operators:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator[ hazelcast/hazelcast-operator^]: Hazelcast Operator hosted on Docker Hub
* https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator[hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator^]: Red Hat certified Hazelcast Enterprise Operator hosted on Docker Hub
* https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator/5eb3bf9bac3db90370945f59[registry.connect.redhat.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-operator^]: Hazelcast Enterprise Operator hosted on Red Hat Container Catalog

There are a few different ways in using Hazelcast Operators:

* kubectl/oc instructions: See the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator[Hazelcast Operator documentation^].
* OpenShift Web Console: OpenShift provides a way to deploy operators from its UI.
* OperatorHub instructions: Check Operator Hub for https://operatorhub.io/operator/hazelcast-operator[Hazelcast^] and https://operatorhub.io/operator/hazelcast-enterprise-operator[Hazelcast Enterprise^].

Since all the Operators mentioned above are generated from Helm Charts, their functionality and input parameters are exactly the same as in the case of Helm Charts.
