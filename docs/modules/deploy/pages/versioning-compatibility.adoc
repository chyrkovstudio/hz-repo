== Semantic Versioning

Hazelcast Platform uses https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] where versions appear in the following format:

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

For example, in Platform version 5.2.0, *5* is the major version, *1* is the minor version, and *0* is the patch version.

Semantic versioning can be summarized as below:

* MAJOR version; when incompatible API changes are made
* MINOR version; when backward-compatible functionality is added
* PATCH version; when backward-compatible bugs are fixed

== Supported Operating Systems

Hazelcast Platform has been tested against the following operating systems.

== Supported Java Virtual Machines

Hazelcast runs on Java, so it needs a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Hazelcast supports the latest and long-term support (LTS) versions of the Java Development Kit (JDK). However, the JVM in some JDKs may not be compatible with Hazelcast.

Hazelcast Platform {full-version} has been tested against the following JDKs.

TIP: If you install Hazelcast with Docker or a package manager, it comes with a supported JDK.

// tag::supported-jvms[]

.Supported JDKs
|===
|JDK | Versions

|AdoptOpenJDK
|8 and 11

|Amazon Corretto
|8, 11 and 17

|Azul Zing
|8

|Azul Zulu
| 8, 11, and 17

|IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition
|8 (latest)

|Oracle
|8, 11, and 17

|Red Hat build of OpenJDK
|8, 11, and 17

// end::supported-jvms[]

If you use version 11 or later of a JDK, see the following relevant sections:

* xref:running-in-modular-java.adoc[]: Talks about the
new module system and how you can run a Hazelcast
application on it.
* xref:security:tls-ssl.adoc#tlsssl-for-hazelcast-members[TLS/SSL for Hazelcast Members]: Lists
`TLSv1.3`, which comes with Java 11, as a supported TLS version.
