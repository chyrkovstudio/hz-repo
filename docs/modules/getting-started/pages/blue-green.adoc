= Deploy Blue-Green Clusters
:description: This tutorial introduces you to blue-green cluster deployments. At the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to set up a client to operate continuously even when its connected cluster fails.

{description} When clients are connected to a single cluster, that cluster becomes a single point of failure: If the cluster fails for any reason, the client cannot connect to it and the application may break. To make clients more robust, you can set up a blue-green cluster deployment, which provides a client failover mechanism for rerouting the client connections to a different cluster without requiring a
client network configuration update or client restart. You can use a blue-green deployment to manually redirect client traffic while you perform maintenance or software updates,
as well as automatically redirect client traffic to a different cluster during a disaster recovery scenario.

This tutorial focuses on the disaster recovery scenario, where you will complete the following steps:

. Start two Enterprise clusters: One for the blue deployment, one for the green deployment.
. Configure a Java client to use the blue-green deployment as a failover.
. Connect the Java client to the blue cluster.
. Shut down the blue cluster and see that the client connects to the green one.

NOTE: Blue-Green deployment is currently supported by Hazelcast's Java, Node.js, and Go clients.

== Before You Begin

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Prerequisites|Useful resources

|Trial license
|https://trialrequest.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast website]

|Docker image for the full Hazelcast distribution
|xref:get-started-enterprise.adoc[Install Hazelcast Enterprise]

|Docker network with the name `hazelcast-network`
|Use the `docker network create hazelcast-network` command 

|===

== Step 1. Start the Blue Enterprise Cluster

In this step, you use the Hazelcast Enterprise Docker image to start a local single-member cluster called `blue`.
This step also installs your Enterprise license key.

Run the following command on the terminal:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=blue \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your license key> \ <1>
    -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{full-version}
----
<1> Replace the `<your license key>` placeholder with your Hazelcast Enterprise license key.

You should see your cluster name in the console along with the IP address of the Docker container that's running the Hazelcast member.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
2021-12-01 18:26:42,369 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.c.ClusterService]: [172.18.0.2]:5701 [blue] [{full-version}] 

Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [172.18.0.2]:5701 - c00213e1-da50-4b5f-a53b-ccfe4a1ebeea this
]

2021-12-01 18:26:42,384 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.c.LifecycleService]: [172.18.0.2]:5701 [blue] [{full-version}] [172.18.0.2]:5701 is STARTED
----

== Step 2. Start the Green Enterprise Cluster

Start another local single-member cluster called `green`.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    --rm \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=green \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your license key> \ <1>
    -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{full-version}
----
<1> Replace with your actual Hazelcast Enterprise license key

See the green cluster is formed:

[source,shell]
----
2021-12-01 18:28:46,299 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.c.ClusterService]: [172.18.0.3]:5701 [green] [5.0] 

Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [172.18.0.3]:5701 - 72f5520c-8c27-4501-9199-a8da6b58c0b4 this
]

2021-12-01 18:28:46,321 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.c.LifecycleService]: [172.18.0.3]:5701 [green] [5.0] [172.18.0.3]:5701 is STARTED
----

Now, you have two separate Hazelcast Enterprise clusters running on your local.

== Step 3. Configure the Client

In this step, you'll configure a client, so that it initially connects to the `blue` cluster, and when
the `blue` cluster is down, it automatically connects to the `green` cluster.

For this, you need to create two client configurations for the same client, and pass these to a failover configuration.

. Create the client configuration file for the `blue` cluster, called `client-blue.yaml` (or `client-blue.xml`).

        </cluster-members>

. Create the client configuration for the `green` cluster, called `client-green.yaml` (or `client-green.xml`).

        </cluster-members>
    </network>
</hazelcast-client>
----
====
. Create the client failover configuration by passing the above two client configurations.
Name of this configuration file must be `hazelcast-client-failover.yaml` (or `hazelcast-client-failover.xml`).
+
[tabs] 
==== 
YAML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,shell]
----
hazelcast-client-failover:
  try-count: 4
  clients:
    - client-blue.yaml
    - client-green.yaml
----
--

XML::
+
[source,shell]
----
<hazelcast-client-failover>
    <try-count>4</try-count>
    <clients>
        <client>client-blue.xml</client>
        <client>client-green.xml</client>
    </clients>
</hazelcast-client-failover>
----
====
+
In this failover configuration file, you are directing the client to connect to the clusters in the given order from top to bottom;
see xref:clients:java#ordering-of-clusters-when-clients-try-to-connect[Ordering of Clusters]. So, when you start the client
(see Step 4 below), it will initially connect to the blue cluster. Here is what may happen:

* When the `blue` cluster fails, the client attempts to reconnect to it four times.
* If the connection is unsuccessful, the client will try to connect to the `green` cluster four times.
* If these eight connection attempts are unsuccessful, the client shuts down.

== Step 4. Connect the Client to Blue Cluster

In this step, you'll start the client.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastFailoverClient();
----

Assuming that the blue cluster is alive, you should see a log similar to the following on the blue clusterâ€™s terminal, showing that the client is connected.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
2021-12-01 18:11:33,928 [ INFO] [hz.wizardly_taussig.priority-generic-operation.thread-0] [c.h.c.i.p.t.AuthenticationMessageTask]: [172.18.0.2]:5701 [blue] [{full-version}] Received auth from Connection[id=5, /172.18.0.2:5701->/172.18.0.1:61254, qualifier=null, endpoint=[172.18.0.1]:61254, alive=true, connectionType=JVM, planeIndex=-1], successfully authenticated, clientUuid: bf2ba9e2-d6f5-4a63-af43-e8d5ed8174b4, client name: hz.client_1, client version: {full-version}
----

You can also verify the client is connected on the client side's terminal.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
INFO: hz.client_1 [blue] [{full-version}] Trying to connect to [172.18.0.2]:5701

INFO: hz.client_1 [blue] [{full-version}] HazelcastClient {full-version} (20210922 - dbaeffe) is CLIENT_CONNECTED
----

== Step 5. Kill the Blue Cluster

Now, you'll kill the `blue` cluster and see the client is automatically connected to the `green` failover cluster.

. Shut down the `blue` cluster on its terminal simply by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].
. Verify that the client is connected to the green cluster on the cluster's and client's terminal.

----

== Step 6. Shut Down the Cluster

Shut down the cluster you've created in this tutorial so that you can start a fresh one when you
move to the other tutorials. To shut down the cluster, close the terminals in which the members are running or press kbd:[Ctrl+C] in each terminal.
