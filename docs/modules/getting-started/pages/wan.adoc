= Replicate over WAN
:description: This tutorial guides you to synchronize multiple Hazelcast clusters, which are connected by WANs, to the same state.

{description} If you have maps or caches in your clusters and you want the data stored in these clusters to be replicated,
you can use the WAN Replication feature; it keeps multiple Hazelcast clusters in sync by replicating their state over WAN.

WAN Replication can work in two modes:

* Active-Passive: It is useful for failover scenarios where you want to replicate an active cluster to one or more passive clusters,
for the purpose of maintaining a backup. If the active cluster becomes unavailable, you can redirect the application traffic to the passive cluster.
* Active-Active: In this mode each cluster replicates to all other clusters.

See xref:wan:wan.adoc[here] for an overview of the WAN Replication feature.

This tutorial is for the Active-Passive mode, and you will:

. Start an Enterprise cluster as a passive one
. Start another cluster with WAN Replication configured, this will be the active one
. Create a map in the active cluster with data in it and see the replication to the passive cluster
. Modify some map entries in the active cluster and see the modifications in the passive one

== Step 1. Start the Passive Cluster

In this step we start an Enterprise cluster called `london` with a single member. This will be the **passive** cluster
which means it does not need WAN replication to be configured. Run the following Docker command on a terminal.

[source,shell]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your license key> \
    -e HZ_CLUSTERNAME=london \
    -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:5.0
----

Here is our single-member cluster:

[source,shell]
----
2021-11-23 11:08:15,055 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.c.ClusterService]: [172.18.0.3]:5701 [london] [5.0] 

Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [172.18.0.3]:5701 - bed20746-1505-449b-9f4a-548bcdbe12b8 this
]
----

Note the member's IP address and port since we are going to use it while configuring WAN
replication in the active cluster and connecting Management Center.

== Step 2. Start the Active Cluster

Now we start another Enterprise cluster called `tokyo` with a single member. This will be the **active** cluster
which means it does not need WAN replication to be configured.

Since the configuration for WAN Replication is a bit more detailed, we are going to use a Hazelcast configuration
file and pass it to the Docker command, instead of giving all the configuration options in a single command.

. In an existing or new directory, place a hazelcast.yaml (or xml) file with the following content.
+
[tabs]
====
YAML::
+
--

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  cluster-name: tokyo
  license-key: <your license key>
  wan-replication:
    london-wan-rep:
      batch-publisher:
        londonPublisherId:
          cluster-name: london
          target-endpoints: 172.18.0.3:5701
  map:
    cities: <1>
      wan-replication-ref:
        london-wan-rep: <2>
          republishing-enabled: false
  jet:
    enabled: true <3>
----
--
<1> Name of the map we are going to create.
<2> Name of the WAN replication configuration (given under the `wan-replication` tag) which provides the details on where the map data will be replicated.
<3> We need to enable the Jet engine since we are going to use SQL for creating, updating and monitoring the map.

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <cluster-name>tokyo</cluster-name>
    <license-key>"your license key"</license-key>
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        <batch-publisher>
            <cluster-name>london</cluster-name>
            <publisher-id>londonPublisherId</publisher-id>
            <target-endpoints>172.18.0.3:5701</target-endpoints>
    <map name="cities">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep">
    </map>
</hazelcast>
----
====
. Open a new terminal and start the active cluster with the above configuration.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run \
     --network hazelcast-network \
     -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhazelcast.config=/opt/hazelcast/config_ext/hazelcast.yaml" -v ~/config-tokyo:/opt/hazelcast/config_ext hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:5.0
----

Here is our other single-member cluster:

[source,shell]
----
2021-11-23 11:39:14,198 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.i.c.ClusterService]: [172.18.0.4]:5701 [tokyo] [5.0] 

Members {size:1, ver:1} [
	Member [172.18.0.4]:5701 - 98d9a815-5eb3-4341-bec1-e9816cee44b5 this
]
----

Note the member's IP address and port since we are going to use it while connecting Management Center.

See xref:wan:defining-wan-replication.adoc#wanbatchreplication-implementation[Configuring WAN Replication] for
configuration element descriptions.

== Step 3. Set Up Management Center

. Start Management Center
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run \
    --network hazelcast-network \
    -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:5.0
----
. Once you see the `Hazelcast Management Center successfully started at http://localhost:8080/` log in the terminal, open a web browser, go to localhost:8080, and enable Dev Mode.
. You will see a **Connect** box on the screen; click on it and enter the passive cluster’s name (`london`) and IP address of its member.
+
image:wan/connect-london-cluster.png[Connect the London cluster]
Management Center is now connected to the `london` cluster.
. Click again on the **Connect** box enter the active cluster’s name (`tokyo`) and IP address of its member.
+
image:wan/cluster-connected.png[Both clusters are connected]
Management Center is now connected to the `tokyo` cluster.
. You need to provide your license key; this is needed since you are going to use the WAN Replication feature for the `tokyo` cluster in Management Center.
Click on **View Cluster** for `tokyo`, go to **Settings** located on the very top right of the user interface and, select **License**.
+
image:wan/provide-license.png[Enter your license key]
Type in your license key and click on **Update License**. Close the license screen.
. Verify that the `tokyo` cluster has WAN Replication enabled. Go to **Cluster > WAN Replication**.
+
image:wan/verify-wan-replication.png[Verify that Tokyo cluster has WAN Replication feature enabled]

== Step 4. Create a Map

In this step you switch to the SQL shell in a terminal, create a map called `cities` for the `tokyo` cluster, and put data into it.

. In a new terminal, start the SQL shell that will be connected to the `tokyo` cluster.
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run --network hazelcast-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:5.0 hz-cli --targets tokyo@172.18.0.4:5701 sql
----
. Once you see the SQL shell (`sql>`), type the following command and press Enter to create the map.
+
[source,shell]
----
CREATE MAPPING cities (__key INT, country VARCHAR, city VARCHAR)
TYPE IMap 
OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat' = 'json-flat');
----
. Then, type the following command and press Enter to add data to the map.
+
[source,shell]
----
INSERT INTO cities VALUES
(1,'Australia','Canberra'),
(2,'Croatia','Zagreb'),
(3,'Czech Republic','Prague'),
(4,'England','London'),
(5,'Turkey','Ankara'),
(6,'United States','Washington, DC');
----
. See the entries by running the following query.
+
[source,shell]
----
SELECT * FROM cities;
----

NOTE: See xref:sql:get-started-sql.adoc[Get Started with SQL over Maps] for more querying options using SQL on maps.

You can also see the map and its entries in Management Center; let's use its SQL browser feature:

. Select `tokyo` in the dropdown field left to "Cluster Connections" on top of the user interface.
. Go to **Storage > Maps**, you will see the `cities` map information.
+
image:wan/map-tokyo.png[Cities map in Tokyo cluster]
. Click on **SQL Browser** located on the very top right of the user interface and choose `cities` in the `select a map` field.
The SQL browser then shows the default query in its editor, `SELECT * FROM cities;`. 
. Click on **Execute Query**; you will see the data we've put in. 
+
image:wan/map-entries.png[Management Center's SQL Browser shows the map data]
. Close the SQL browser.

== Step 5. Verify the Replication

In this step, we will verify that the `cities` map now also exists in the London cluster, i.e., the map and its data have been replicated from the active cluster (Tokyo) to the passive one (London).

. In Management Center, select `london` in the dropdown field left to "Cluster Connections" on top of the user interface.
. Go to **Storage > Maps** and see that the `cities` map is there.

Additionally, you can query the map entries on the London cluster. Let's again, use the SQL browser in Management Center.

. You first need to create the mapping so that the London cluster can read the map entries.
Open the SQL browser, type in the same `CREATE MAPPING` command from Step 4 in the editor, and **Execute Query**.
+
image:wan/create-mapping-london.png[Create mapping on the London cluster]
. In the `select a map` field, choose `cities`. The editor shows the default `SELECT * FROM cities;` query. Once you execute it, you will see the entries of `cities` map, as in Step 4.
. Close the SQL browser.

== Step 6. Update a Map Entry on the Active Cluster

Let's update an entry in the `cities` map on the active cluster (Tokyo) and verify the update is replicated to the passive one (London).

. Select `tokyo` in the dropdown field left to "Cluster Connections" on top of the user interface and go to **SQL Browser**.
. Choose `cities` in the `select a map` field and execute the default `SELECT * FROM "cities"` query.
+
image:wan/entry-tobe-modified.png[]
. Now, we are going to modify the data shown above in the red box (the entry having the key `1`). In the SQL editor, delete the default query and type in the following command.
+
[source,shell]
----
SINK INTO cities VALUES
(1, 'Austria', 'Vienna');
----
Execute the query and see the entry has changed.
+
image:entry-modified.png[Data is modified]
. Close the SQL browser and now go to the passive cluster (London) by choosing `london` in the dropdown field left to "Cluster Connections" on top of the user interface.
. Open the SQL browser, choose `cities` in the `select a map` field and execute the default query.
. You will see the entry having the key `1` is also modified.

In this step, we have seen that a data modification in the active cluster is immediately replicated to the passive one.
If you do the modification first on the passive cluster, you'd see that the modification is not applied to the active one.
