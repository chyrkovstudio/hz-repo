= Installing Hazelcast Enterprise
:description: To install Hazelcast Enterprise, you can use Docker, the binary, or Java. Then, to unlock the Enterprise features, you need to install your Enterprise license key.

{description}

TIP: Hazelcast Enterprise is a commercial product that offers additional features to the Open Source edition, including the security suite and blue/green deployments for clients. If you're looking to get started with open source Hazelcast, see xref:install-hazelcast.adoc[].

== Using the Enterprise Docker Image

. link:https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Install Docker^].

. Check that Docker is correctly installed.
+
[source,bash]
----
docker version
----

. If you do not see a version number, see the link:https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/[Docker docs^] for troubleshooting information.

. Pull the Hazelcast Docker image from Docker Hub.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker pull hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{full-version}
----

== Using the Enterprise Binary

Download and extract the binaries.

==== 
Mac::

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl 'https://download.hazelcast.com/enterprise/hazelcast-enterprise-{full-version}.tar.gz' | tar xvzf -

Windows::

== Using the Enterprise JAR

Hazelcast runs on Java, which means you can add it as a dependency in your Java project.

The Java package includes both a member API and a Java client API. The member API is for xref:ROOT:topologies.adoc[embedded topologies] where you want to deploy and manage a cluster in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as your applications. The Java client is for connecting to an existing member in a client/server topology.

. Download and install a xref:deploy:supported-jvms.adoc[supported JDK].
+
TIP: We recommend installing the link:https://adoptopenjdk.net[AdoptOpenJDK^].

. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file.

== Getting an Enterprise License Key

Hazelcast Enterprise requires a license key. You can get a
30-day trial license from the link:https://hazelcast.com/get-started[Hazelcast website].

[[license-key-format]]License keys have the following format:

```
<Hazelcast edition>#<Maximum members>#<License key>
```

- `<Hazelcast edition>`: Name of the product.
- `<Maximum members>`: Maximum number of members that may use the license at the same time.
- `<License key>`: Machine-readable license key.

The first two strings up to the second hash (#) character are optional. These strings just provide a way for you to know important information about the license key.

For example, both of the following formats are valid:

.Full-form license
```
HazelcastEnterprise#2Nodes#1q2w3e4r5t
```

.Short-form license
```
1q2w3e4r5t
```

NOTE: These licenses are examples and will not work if you install them on members.

== Installing a License Key

To use Hazelcast Enterprise, you need to install a license
key on your members.

NOTE: Hazelcast Enterprise license keys are required only for members.
You do not need to set a license key for Java clients that are connected to members.

[tabs] 
==== 
Binary:: 
+ 
-- 
Add the following to the `hazelcast.xml` file in your `hazelcast-{full-version}/config` directory.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <license-key>Your Enterprise License Key</license-key>
</hazelcast>
----
--

Docker:: 
+ 
-- 
Add your license to the `HZ_LICENSEKEY` environment variable.

[source,bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -e HZ_LICENSEKEY=<your_license_key> hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:{full-version}
----
--

Java::
+
--
Add your license to the `setLicenseKey()` method.

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.setLicenseKey( "Your Enterprise License Key" );
