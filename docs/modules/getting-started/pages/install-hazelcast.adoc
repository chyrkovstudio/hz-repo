== Using Java

Hazelcast runs on Java, which means you can add it as a dependency in your Java project.

The Java package includes both a member API and a Java client API. The member API is for xref:ROOT:topologies.adoc[embedded topologies] where you want to deploy and manage a cluster in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as your applications. The Java client is for connecting to an existing member in a client/server topology.

. Download and install a xref:deploy:supported-jvms.adoc[supported JDK].
+
TIP: We recommend installing the link:https://adoptopenjdk.net[AdoptOpenJDK^].

. If you're using Maven, create a new project and add the following to your `pom.xml` file.

. If you aren't using a build tool, link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/hazelcast/{full-version}/hazelcast-{full-version}.jar[download the Hazelcast JAR file] and add it to your classpath.
