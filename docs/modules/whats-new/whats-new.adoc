What's new in Platform 5.4

First of all, starting with this release of Hazelcast Platform, the minimum supported Java version has become 17.

You can now deploy, undeploy or redeploy your custom classes by using the user code name spacing feature. The feature provides a container for Java classpath resources, such as your classes, and accompanying artifacts like property files - enabling namespace isolation to ensure that access to resources in different namespaces can be managed through configuration.

We've also added a map data structure aligned with your CP subsystem - (C)onsistent and (P)artition tolerant: CPMap. It is a distributed implementation of a minimal key-value interface supporting many atomic operations like get, delete and put.

And many other enhancements...............
