= DMT Command Reference

The DMT commands allow you to manage your migration. DMT extends CLC capabilities, so the configuration is the same as https://docs.hazelcast.com/clc/latest/configuration[CLC's configuration]. DMT has a migration config on top of that which is provided as a path to migration config folder. See below for usage.

The DMT commands have the following format:

[source,bash]
