= Upgrade Cluster to {enterprise-product-name}
:description: You can upgrade your Open Source cluster to an Enterprise cluster using an in-place rolling restart to change each member in turn.

{description}

This approach ensures that you can move your cluster without interruption to the service. 
Similar to the rolling upgrade process, a rolling restart allows you to move one member at a time.

To use a rolling restart to upgrade your cluster to {enterprise-product-name}, the codebase of your {open-source-product-name} cluster must match the target {enterprise-product-name} release. 

For example, you can use a rolling restart to upgrade your cluster from {open-source-product-name} 5.5 to {enterprise-product-name} 5.5. However, you cannot use a rolling restart to move to {enterprise-product-name} 5.5 from an earlier {open-source-product-name} release, such as 5.3. To move from an earlier {open-source-product-name} release, you must migrate your {open-source-product-name} data and any other associated updates, then set-up {enterprise-product-name}. You might find the Data Migration Tool (DMT) suitable for migrating your data. For further information on the DMT, see xref:migrate:data-migration-tool.adoc[].

== Best Practice

Before starting a rolling restart, consider the following best practices:

* Backup your IMap and ReplicatedMap data structures using your usual method. This is not essential, but it is recommended practice
* Ensure that the version of JDK meets the minimum required for the target {enterprise-product-name} release
* Plan sufficient time for the rolling restart to complete, and remember that the member cannot change during the move

== Perform a Rolling Restart

To move your {open-source-product-name} cluster to {enterprise-product-name}, complete the following steps:

. Gracefully shut down an existing {open-source-product-name} member.
+
See xref:maintain-cluster:shutdown.adoc#shutting-down-a-hazelcast-member[Shutting Down a Hazelcast Member].

. Wait for all partitions to migrate to the rest of the cluster.
+
During migrations, members cannot join or leave the cluster.

. Upgrade the member's codebase to match the {enterprise-product-name} version.

. Start the member and wait until it joins the {enterprise-product-name} cluster.

. Repeat this process for each member in the {open-source-product-name} cluster.

. When all members on the {open-source-product-name} cluster have been moved to the {enterprise-product-name} cluster, enable and configure the 
{enterprise-product-name} features that you want to use using dynamic configuration.

For further information on dynamic configuration, see xref:configuration:dynamic-config.adoc[].
