= Upgrading to Hazelcast 5.0

This section lists the distribution, documentation and API changes for you to be
aware when upgrading to Hazelcast 5.0 from previous versions of Hazelcast and Jet.

NOTE: Hazelcast offers tools and features for a smooth migration from
IMDG/Jet 3.12/4.x to Platform 5.0. See <<migration-tool-imdg, here>> and <<migration-tool-jet, here>> to learn
more.

== Merge of Hazelcast and Jet

The open source and Enterprise code and documentation of former Hazelcast IMDG and Jet have been merged
as Hazelcast, as version 5.0. The following sections elaborate the changes performed for this merge.

== Version Compatibility

You can find the rules for compatibility in this section.

=== Semantic Versioning

Hazelcast uses https://semver.org/[semantic versioning]:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible issue fixes.

=== Compatibility with Former IMDG Versions

Hazelcast 5.0 is fully compatible with former Hazelcast IMDG 4.x and 3.12.x versions.

=== Compatibility with Former Jet Versions

Hazelcast 5.0's Jet engine does not provide backwards compatibility
(rolling upgrades and client compatibility); only API compatibility is provided
(the API that was compiled in former Jet 4.x can be compiled in Hazelcast 5.0's
Jet engine), and these are the Job and Pipeline APIs.

For example a Hazelcast job written using Pipeline API in a previous
minor version should compile in later minor versions.

=== Compatibility with Client Versions

All the 4.x.y versions of Hazelcast .NET, C++. Python and Node.js clients are compatible
with Hazelcast 5.0.

All the 4.x.y and 3.12.x versions of Hazelcast Java client are compatible with Hazelcast 5.0.

The Hazelcast Go client 1.0.0 version is compatible with Hazelcast 5.0.

=== Compatibility with Management Center Versions

Previous versions of Hazelcast Management Center does not work with Hazelcast 5.0;
only Management Center 5.0 does.

=== API Compatibility

* Pipeline and Job APIs provide compatibilities between Hazelcast minor versions.
* Core API is compatible between Hazelcast patch versions.
* Types and methods annotated with `@EvolvingApi` only provide PATCH
level compatibility guarantee. These are typically new features where
the API is subject to further changes.
* Classes in `impl` packages do not provide any compatibility guarantees
between versions and are not meant for public use.

== Licenses

* You are able to use your current Hazelcast Enterprise/Enterprise HD and Hazelcast Enterprise licenses
when moving to Hazelcast 5.0 without any license upgrade.
* If you have a Hazelcast Enterprise or Enterprise HD license, you will be able to discover and use
Hazelcast's Jet features (both the open source and Enterprise ones) when you move to Hazelcast 5.0.
* Hazelcast 5.0 does not offer the former Pro Edition for Hazelcast. Existing Pro Edition customers'
licenses will be renewed if requested.
* All the features of Hazelcast open source edition are available in Hazelcast 5.0.

== Merge of SQL Modules

The former Hazelcast product had `hazelcast-sql`, `hazelcast-sql-core` and
`hazelcast-jet-sql` Maven modules in its distribution. These have been merged into
a single `hazelcast-sql` module as a part of the Hazelcast 5.0 distribution.

== Removal of Jet Spring Module

The former `jet-spring` module which was used to configure Hazelcast using Spring has
been merged into the `hazelcast-spring` module.

== Changes in Distribution Packaging

Former Hazelcast IMDG product had `hazelcast` and `hazelcast-all` modules
for the core distribution and the distribution with all extensions, respectively.
Similarly, Hazelcast Jet had `slim` and `full` distribution packaging.

NOTE: The `hazelcast-all` module has been removed after the merge of former IMDG and Jet products.

Hazelcast 5.0 provides, like the former Jet product, `slim` and `full` packagings.

The `slim` one includes only the following:

* Hazelcast runtime
* Default configuration files (not example ones)
* Scripts
* SQL
* Management Center

The `full` one includes the following:

* Hazelcast and its modules contained in the former `hazelcast-all`
** AWS discovery plugin
** Kubernetes discovery plugin
** GCP discovery plugin
** Azure discovery plugin
** Hazelcast Hibernate
** Hazelcast Spring
** SQL
* Jet extensions
* Management center

=== Script Files

With the merge of former IMDG and Jet products, there have been changes made to the scripts provided in the distributions.

== Changes in Configuration

With the merge of former Hazelcast IMDG and Jet products into Hazelcast 5.0,
there have been changes in the configuration mechanism as described in the below
subsections.

=== Merge of Declarative Configurations

The former Hazelcast and Jet declarative configuration
files have been merged into a single Hazelcast XML/YAML
file. Basically, the Jet configuration elements have been added to
the IMDG's XML/YAML files. See the Jet engine related configuration elements in the unified file
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-full-example.yaml#L3490[here]

=== Introduction of YAML Configuration Validator

Hazelcast 5.0 checks and validates your YAML configurations during a cluster startup.
According to this validation:

* the top-level `hazelcast` object must exist 
* client and member YAML configurations must be separate, not in the same file
* there must be no case insensitive enum values.

While upgrading to Hazelcast 5.0, if a YAML configuration violates any of the above,
the cluster will not start. You need to either edit and update your YAML configuration files
accordingly or disable the validation by setting the `yaml.config.validation.skip` property to `true`.

== Replacement of JetInstance with JetService

Previously, the Jet instance was created as shown below:

```
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
JetInstance jet = hz.getJetInstance();
// as if two separate instances were created
```

This has been changed as follows:

```
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
JetService jet = hz.getJet(); // no longer have shutdown(), getMap(), getList() etc.
```

== Depreciation of the `Jet` and `JetInstance` Classes

The `Jet` class, which was the main entry point of the former Hazelcast product,
has been deprecated. Also, we deprecated the `JetInstance` class, which was previously
representing an instance of Jet member or Jet client. This change aims to consider
Jet as an extension service to `HazelcastInstance` instead of being an instance on its own
which encapsulates `HazelcastInstance`. With 5.0, we introduced a new class called `JetService`.

Together with `HazelcastInstance`, `JetService` replaces all the usages of the `JetInstance`.
Previously, `JetInstance` was mainly used for the functionalities listed below:

* Submitting streaming/batch jobs to the cluster and managing them -> `JetService` replaces this functionality.
* To access Hazelcast data structures -> `HazelcastInstance` replaces this functionality.
The only exception is Jet observables. The observables is a Jet data structure and we ported it to `JetService`. 
* Performing cluster operations such as shutting down the cluster -> `HazelcastInstance` replaces this functionality.

To access Jet related services such as submitting jobs, you should use `JetService` which can get from `HazelcastInstance#getJet()`
after creating `HazelcastInstance` using one of the static factory methods of a Hazelcast class.

== Depreciation of `Jet.bootstrappedInstance`

Jet's `bootstrappedInstance()` has been deprecated as the `Jet` class. As the
replacement, we have introduced `Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance()`. You can use it as
shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomJetJob {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance();
      JetInstance jet = hz.getJetInstance();
      jet.newJob(buildPipeline()).join();
    }
 
    public static Pipeline createPipeline() {
        // ...
    }
  }
----

== Changes in `DefaultNodeExtension`

The `JetNodeExtension` class has been merged into the `DefaultNodeExtension`.
With the merge of former IMDG and Jet products, there is now a single unified
node extension.
