* Added `JSON` as a supported type for the SQL engine with functions like `JSON_QUERY` and `JSON_VALUE`;
they return a JSON object/array and a primitive value, respectively.

For an overview of JSON in SQL, see xref:sql:working-with-json.adoc[].

=== Cloud Discovery Plugins

* Added `EndpointSlices` support for the Kubernetes discovery plugin; now the `EndpointSlices` API usage is default,
and the old `Endpoints` API is not used as a fallback if `EndpointSlices` are not available.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19643[#19643]

=== Serialization

* Updated the names of methods and fields in the Compact Serialization API to make them
non-Java centric.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20257[#20257]
* Added the declarative configuration elements for Compact Serialization.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20016[#20016]
* Introduced the `FieldKind` class to get the field types for portable and compact serializations;
previously it was `FieldType`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19517[#19517]

=== Configuration

* Introduced a system property for allowing you to audit that all the Hazelcast instances
running in your environment have the instance tracking file name set correctly in the configuration.
See the note in xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring#instance-tracking[Instance Tracking].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19928[#19928]

=== Management Center

* Added the `data-access-enabled` property for the Management Center configuration on the member side.
This allows you to enable or disable the access of Management Center to the data stored by the data structures in the cluster.
Management Center can't access the data if at least one member has the data access disabled. Its default value is `true` (enabled).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19991[#19991]
* Added the `console-enabled` property for the Management Center configuration on the member side.
This allows you to disable the console feature on Management Center as it supports lots of operations and it's not subject
to the regular access restrictions; it can read from/write to any data structure even if Management Center is restricted
to access those via client permissions.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19718[#19718]

=== Support for JDK 17

Hazelcast now supports JDK 17. See xref:deploy:supported-jvms.adoc[].

=== Other Enhancements

* Updated log4j2 dependency version to 2.17.1 in Hazelcast's root `pom.xml`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20184[#20184]
* The `hz-start` script now accepts absolute paths when providing the Hazelcast configuration file's location.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19908[#19908]
* JSON strings can now work with paging predicate queries.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19880[#19880] 
* You can now check if Hazelcast is started properly in the Docker environment simply by using
a `curl` command, e.g., `curl -f http://hazelcast-host:5701/hazelcast/health/ready`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19664[#19664]
* Hazelcast's memcached implementation was interpreting the number values and parameters
for `incr` and `decr` wrongly (numbers were being converted into byte arrays instead of decimals).
This has been fixed by making these commands' implementations strictly follow the
memcached protocol specification.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19653[#19653]
* Since the name of Hot Restart Persistence feature changed to Persistence, the prefix for its
metrics also has been changed from "hot-restart" to "persistence".
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19543[#19543]
* Improved the speed of connection by a member when it joins the cluster, by removing the unnecessary
sleep statements in the code.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18932[#18932]

== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where a single SQL query having a mix of JSON string and `HazelcastJsonValue` for the `INSERT` statement
was not working.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20303[#20303]
* Fixed various issues when using hostnames in Hazelcast's network and WAN Replication configurations.
With this fix, you can seamlessly use hostnames wherever the IP addresses of the members are used.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20014[#20014],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15722[#15722]
* Fixed an issue where the `hazelcast.yaml` file was ignored when it is the only configuration file present in the
Hazelcast setup; during startup it was looking only for the `hazelcast.xml` file and producing an error message saying that
the configuration does not exist even though there is the `yaml` configuration file. Now it automatically uses `hazelcast.yaml`
when `hazelcast.xml` is not available.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20003[#20003]
* Fixed an issue where the Hazelcast command line interfaces commands were outputting incorrect command names
when you want to see their usages using the `--help` argument. For example, the command `hz-start --help` was outputting
the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
Usage: hazelcast-start [-d]
  -d, --daemon   Starts Hazelcast in daemon mode
----
+
instead of the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
Usage: hz-start [-d]
  -d, --daemon   Starts Hazelcast in daemon mode
----
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20001[#20001]
* Fixed an issue where querying a map with `SELECT` (SQL) was failing when the data has compact serialization
and the cluster has more than one member (with the  class not being on the classpath).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19952[#19952]
* In Kubernetes environment, when the health check endpoint was taking too long to respond,
the Hazelcast members were considered to be unresponsive and terminated; this issue has been fixed.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19829[#19829]
* Fixed an issue where the command `hz-stop --help` was not displaying the help but executing
the `hz-stop` command.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19749[#19749]
* When you both enable the persistence and automatic removal of stale data in the configuration,
member startup failures were occurring. This has been fixed by adding the `auto-remove-stale-data`
element to the configuration schema.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19683[#19683]
* Fixed an issue where the `totalPublishes` statistics for the Reliable Topic data structure
were always generated as `0`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19642[#19642]
* Fixed an issue where some Spring XML configuration elements having values as property placeholders
were not working when Hazelcast is upgraded to a newer version.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19629[#19629]
* Fixed an issue where the `totalPublishes` statistics for the Reliable Topic data structure
were always generated as `0`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19555[#19555]
* Fixed an issue where the serialization was failing when the object has enum fields, or it is an enum itself.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19314[#19314]

== Removed/Deprecated Features

* Deprecated the `log(LogEvent logEvent)` method in the `ILogger` class (`com.hazelcast.logging.ILogger`).

* We've discontinued support for the Elasticsearch 5 connector because this version is no longer maintained by the Elastic team, and it includes security vulverabilities that will not be fixed. See the link:https://www.elastic.co/support/eol[Elastic support docs].
