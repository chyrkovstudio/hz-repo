= 5.1 Release Notes

Hazelcast Platform is a major release which unifies
the former Hazelcast IMDG and Jet products in a
single solution.

For information about upgrading from previous IMDG and Jet
releases, see the xref:migrate:upgrade.adoc[Upgrading to Hazelcast Platform section].

To learn about the changes in previous IMDG and Jet releases, see https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/rn/[IMDG release notes] and
https://jet-start.sh/blog/[Jet release notes].

== New Features

* **Tiered Storage (BETA)**: Introduced the Tiered Storage feature which is an extension to Hazelcast Map
allowing you to store map data both in the memory and on the disk. It is an Hazelcast Enterprise feature
and in BETA state. See the xref:tiered-storage.adoc[Tiered Storage section].
* **Persistence for Dynamic Configuration:** You can now reload the updates made in the dynamic configuration
after a cluster restart. See the xref:persist-dynamic-conf.adoc[Persisting Changes in Dynamic Configuration section].

== Enhancements

=== SQL Engine

* Added support of the following statements, operators, and functions:
** `CREATE VIEW`
** `DROP VIEW`
** `EXPLAIN`
** `CREATE INDEX`
** `IMPOSE_ORDER` to enhance the given input table with watermarks
** `UNION`
** `UNION ALL`
** `EXISTS`
** `NOT EXISTS`
** `TUMBLE(TABLE table, DESCRIPTOR(column), window_size)` to enhance the input relation with the `window_start` and `window_end` columns

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19589[#19589]
* Added `JSON` as a supported type for the SQL engine with functions like `JSON_QUERY` and `JSON_VALUE`;
they return a JSON object/array and a primitive value, respectively.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19303[#19303]

=== Cloud Discovery Plugins

* Added `EndpointSlices` support for the Kubernetes discovery plugin; now the `EndpointSlices` API usage is default,
and the old `Endpoints` API is not used as a fallback if `EndpointSlices` are not available.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19643[#19643]

=== Serialization

* Updated the names of methods and fields in the Compact Serialization API to make them
non-Java centric.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20257[#20257]
* Added the declarative configuration elements for Compact Serialization.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20016[#20016]
* Introduced the `FieldKind` class to get the field types for portable and compact serializations;
previously it was `FieldType`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19517[#19517]

=== Configuration

* Introduced a system property for allowing you to audit that all the Hazelcast instances
running in your environment have the instance tracking file name set correctly in the configuration.
See the note in xref:maintain-cluster:monitoring#instance-tracking[Instance Tracking].
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19928[#19928]

=== Management Center

* Added the `data-access-enabled` property for the Management Center configuration on the member side.
This allows you to enable or disable the access of Management Center to the data stored by the data structures in the cluster.
Management Center can't access the data if at least one member has the data access disabled. Its default value is `true` (enabled).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19991[#19991]
* Added the `console-enabled` property for the Management Center configuration on the member side.
This allows you to disable the console feature on Management Center as it supports lots of operations and it's not subject
to the regular access restrictions; it can read from/write to any data structure even if Management Center is restricted
to access those via client permissions.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19718[#19718]

=== Tiered Storage

* Introduced the hybrid log allocator;  hybrid log is used for allocating slots for the
records stored in the log and for moving these slots between multiple devices,
such as the main memory, disks, Optane, remote devices, etc. #4430

=== Other Enhancements

* Updated log4j2 dependency version to 2.16.0 in Hazelcast's root `pom.xml`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20184[#20184]
* The `hz-start` script now accepts absolute paths when providing the Hazelcast configuration file's location.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19908[#19908]
* JSON strings can now work with paging predicate queries.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19880[#19880] 
* You can now check if Hazelcast is started properly in the Docker environment simply by using
a `curl` command, e.g., `curl -f http://hazelcast-host:5701/hazelcast/health/ready`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19664[#19664]
* Hazelcast's memcached implementation was interpreting the number values and parameters
for `incr` and `decr` wrongly (numbers were being converted into byte arrays instead of decimals).
This has been fixed by making these commands' implementations strictly follow the
memcached protocol specification.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19653[#19653]
* Since the name of Hot Restart Persistence feature changed to Persistence, the prefix for its
metrics also has been changed from "hot-restart" to "persistence".
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19543[#19543]
* Improved the speed of connection by a member when it joins the cluster, by removing the unnecessary
sleep statements in the code.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18932[#18932]

== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where a single SQL query having a mix of JSON string and `HazelcastJsonValue` for the `INSERT` statement
was not working.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20303[#20303]
* Fixed various issues when using hostnames in Hazelcast's network and WAN Replication configurations.
With this fix, you can seamlessly use hostnames wherever the IP addresses of the members are used.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20014[#20014],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15722[#15722]
* Fixed an issue where the `hazelcast.yaml` file was ignored when it is the only configuration file present in the
Hazelcast setup; during startup it was looking only for the `hazelcast.xml` file and producing an error message saying that
the configuration does not exist even though there is the `yaml` configuration file. Now it automatically uses `hazelcast.yaml`
when `hazelcast.xml` is not available.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20003[#20003]
* Fixed an issue where the Hazelcast command line interfaces commands were outputting incorrect command names
when you want to see their usages using the `--help` argument. For example, the command `hz-start --help` was outputting
the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
Usage: hazelcast-start [-d]
  -d, --daemon   Starts Hazelcast in daemon mode
----
+
instead of the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
Usage: hz-start [-d]
  -d, --daemon   Starts Hazelcast in daemon mode
----
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/20001[#20001]
* Fixed an issue where querying a map with `SELECT` (SQL) was failing when the data has compact serialization
and the cluster has more than one member (with the  class not being on the classpath).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19952[#19952]
* Hazelcast was executing cluster wide operations when you query the state of a member using the health
check endpoint - it was causing to kill all the members in a cluster; this issue has been fixed.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19829[#19829]
* Fixed an issue where the command `hz-stop --help` was not displaying the help but executing
the `hz-stop` command.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19749[#19749]
* When you both enable the persistence and automatic removal of stale data in the configuration,
member startup failures were occurring. This has been fixed by adding the `auto-remove-stale-data`
element to the configuration schema.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19683[#19683]
* Fixed an issue where the `totalPublishes` statistics for the Reliable Topic data structure
were always generated as `0`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19642[#19642]
* Fixed an issue where some Spring XML configuration elements having values as property placeholders
were not working when Hazelcast is upgraded to a newer version.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19629[#19629]
* Fixed an issue where the `totalPublishes` statistics for the Reliable Topic data structure
were always generated as `0`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19555[#19555]
* Fixed an issue where the serialization was failing when the object has enum fields, or it is an enum itself.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19314[#19314]

== Removed/Deprecated Features

* Deprecated the `log(LogEvent logEvent)` method in the `ILogger` class (`com.hazelcast.logging.ILogger`).
