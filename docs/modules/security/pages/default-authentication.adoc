= Default authentication
[[default-authentication]]
:page-enterprise: true

The Default Authentication is used when security is enabled and no explicit
authentication configuration is provided. It can happen when:

* `member-authentication` is not configured
* the security realm referenced by `member-authentication` doesn't contain the `authentication` configuration
* `client-authentication` is not configured
* the security realm referenced by `client-authentication` doesn't contain the `authentication` configuration.

The behavior of the default authentication mechanism depends on **member's identity configuration**
(i.e., `identity` configuration in the security realm referenced from `member-authentication`).
If the `identity` is configured as a `username-password`, then the authenticated username and password
credentials are checked for equality with these configured ones. In all other cases, only the incoming
cluster name is checked for equality with the one configured on the authenticating member.
