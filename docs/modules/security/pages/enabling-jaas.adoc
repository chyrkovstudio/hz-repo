= Enabling JAAS Security
:page-enterprise: true

With Hazelcast's extensible, JAAS based security feature, you can:

* authenticate both cluster members and clients
* and perform access control checks on client operations.
Access control can be done according to endpoint principal
and/or endpoint address.

You can enable security declaratively or programmatically,
as shown below.
